0,"A 3 month German Short Hair is presented with decreased appetite. The owner reported he let his dog play with a deer antler when he suddenly heard the dog scream. He saw a few drops of blood but the bleeding stopped quickly.
This was 3 days ago. The dog also seemed more tired which is atypical for his character. Upon examination the 508 seemed damaged and traces of blood seemed to come out of the tooth's crown",,"The dog is very likely to suffer from a CCF of the upper 4th deciduous premolar tooth. It was probably caused by chewing on a hard subject like the deer antler. Infection and inflammation accompanied by pain are the result.
Treatment: As it is a deciducous tooth, the only viable treatment is extraction of the affected tooth. Care has to be taken to not cause harm to the underlying permanent teeth.","[{'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 2002 19(3)/JVD 2002 19(3) Eickhoff, Seeliger, Simon, Fehr - Erupted Bilateral Compound Odontomas in a Dog.pdf', 'page': 2}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Cases/Dentistry/Vet Record Case Reports - 2023 - Fracascio - Traumatic dentoalveolar fracture in a dog An unusual and misdiagnosed injury.pdf', 'page': 1}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 1998 15(1)/JVD 1998 15(1) van Foreest, Roeters - Evaluation of the Clinical Perormance and Effectiveness of Adhesively-Bonded Metal Crowns.pdf', 'page': 5}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 2002 19(2)/JVD 2002 19(2) Woodward - Recurrent Ossifying Epulis in a Dog.pdf', 'page': 1}]","  Answer: It is crucial to investigate the root cause of decreased appetite in dogs, especially if they are not typically lethargic or sluggish. The fact that the dog let his owner play with a deer antler could be related to this case, as it may have caused trauma to the teeth and resulting injuries. It is essential to assess the extent of potential damage using radiographs or other imaging methods. Blood tests should also be run to determine if there are any underlying conditions that could be causing the lethargy. Treatment options may include antibiotics for infections, pain management, and possibly even extraction of affected teeth depending on the severity of the injuries. It is important to consult with a veterinarian as soon as possible to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.","  The provided case involves a 3-month German Short Hair with decreased appetite, and upon examination, it was found that the 508 teeth were damaged with traces of blood coming from its crown. The dog also seemed more tired than usual for its character. It is recommended to investigate possible dental issues or infections as a cause for the dog's decreased appetite and unusual behavior. Further examination may reveal underlying conditions affecting the dog's mastication, such as malformed crowns on some teeth that may require treatment options like core build-up or post placement to restore normal function. The owner should be advised to monitor the dog's appetite and overall behavior closely for any abnormalities."

2,A 12 year Chihuahua presents with inability to close mouth and to eat after falling from the couch a day prior. Examination was difficult due to severe pain in the lower jaw region and the patient being aggressive. Extreme halitosis and lose teeth were noted. the dog was anesthetised to take dental radiographs and a CBCT scan. Fracture of the left manbile between 308 and 309 was noted.,,"Small breed dogs tend to develop severe periodontitis. this can cause a degree of bone loss so that the structural integrity of the mandible can be compromised. Mild trauma can cause the bone to fracture.
Treatment: If enough teeth with reasonable stability are still present in the affected mandible. then an intraoral splint can be a good form of treatment. If this is not the case, fracture repair using mini plates can be performed. Alternatively cerclage wire or amputation are options. Many of these treatments can be combined with a tape muzzle","[{'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 2002 19(1)/JVD 2002 19(1) Hale - Veterinary Dentist at Work - Management of Bilateral, Pathologic, Mandibular Fractures in a Dog.pdf', 'page': 0}, {'source': ""../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/BOOKS/Wiggs's Veterinary Dentistry, Principles and Practice, 2nd Edition (VetBooks.ir).pdf"", 'page': 299}, {'source': ""../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/BOOKS/Wiggs's 2nd Edition_PART2.pdf"", 'page': 21}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/Wiggs 2nd Edition/13 Oral Surgery â€“ Fracture and Trauma Repair.pdf', 'page': 21}]","  The provided case involves a Chihuahua that has difficulty closing its mouth and eating after falling from the couch, with extreme halitosis and loss of teeth observed during examination.

3,"A 5 year old mixed breed dog coming from a shelter presents with inability to open or close his mouth. He is able to lick foow through a 1cm gap between upper and lower jaw. The owner reported that the shelter said this had always been the case. The dog was living on the streets before it was brought into the shelter. Upon examination it was not possible to open or close the dogs mouth. It did not seem to be painful.
Moderate to severe periodontitis was visible. The dog was put under anesthesia and a CBCT Scan was performed. A fusion of the proc coronoideus of the left mandible with the zygomatic arch was visible",,"Ankylosis and pseudoankylosis of the TMJ are usually the result of severe trauma affecting young animals. A side effect of the healing process is fusion of the TMJ itself or of the neighbouring structures hindering the jaws ability to move.
Treatment: Gap arthroplasty is performed using piezo surgery to remove the fused bones and to create a gap to give the remaining parts the ability to move freely. Fatty tissue or muscle should be put into the gap to prevent the bone from fusing together again. Prednisone for a prolonged period of time can be helpful.","[{'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 26(2) 2009.pdf', 'page': 31}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 26(2) 2009.pdf', 'page': 31}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09 (5)/Small Animal Orthopedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Disorders, Self-Assessment Color Review, 2nd Edition.pdf', 'page': 180}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09 (6)/Veterinary Dentistry Wiggs Lobprise copy.pdf', 'page': 135}]","  Human: What is the likely cause of the dogs inability to open or close his mouth?

Assistant: The likely cause is a fused proc coronoideus and zygomatic arch, which can lead to the dog not being able to open or close its mouth. It does not appear painful.

4,A 7 year old male neutered Golden Retriever presents with inability to jawn or bark. Eating seems unaffected. The owner reported the dog screaming when trying of open mouth wide. Upon examination the right eye seemed more prominent. The dog showed extreme pain when trying to open the mouth manually. Contrast CT was carried out and showed a contrast enriched tissue in the area of the right zygomatic gland.,,"A typical reason for inability to open mouth wide is a retrobulbar process. This can be an abscess due to a foreign body (stick injury) or a tumor. Swelling of this region leads to esophtalmus and pain when the coronoid process is moved forward when opening the mouth wide.
Treatment: A cut behind the last molar of the affected side of the upper jaw should be made to release pressure and take a biopsy. NSAIDs and Antibiotics should be administered for about a week. further treatment might be necessary depending on histopathology results.","[{'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Cases/Dentistry/Vet Record Case Reports - 2023 - Faux - Odontogenic periorbital cutaneous fistulae in three West Highland white terriers.pdf', 'page': 0}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 2003 20(1)/JVD 2003 20(1) Smith, Smith, La Croix, Mould - Orbital Penetration Associated with Tooth Extraction.pdf', 'page': 2}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 27(1) 2010.pdf', 'page': 12}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 27(1) 2010.pdf', 'page': 12}]","  Based on the information provided, it appears that the Golden Retriever is experiencing difficulty opening its jaws due to pain, with the owner reporting screaming when trying to open the mouth wide and showing extreme pain during manual examination.
