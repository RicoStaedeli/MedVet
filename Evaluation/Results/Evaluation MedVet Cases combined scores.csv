1,"Jake is a 3-year-old neutered German shepherd. His owner noticed that her pet‚Äôs breath was pretty smelly, and she also found traces of blood on his chew toys. She brought Jake in for his annual wellness visit and asked if she should be concerned about these issues. On examination, Jake‚Äôs gums were red and swollen, and bleeding in some areas.",-,"Periodontal disease is present to some degree in most pets age 3 and older. The condition starts when bacteria colonize food particles in a pet‚Äôs mouth and form plaque on their teeth. The plaque solidifies and becomes calculus, or tartar. In addition, the bacteria can invade under your pet‚Äôs gumline, resulting in inflammation and damage to the structures supporting their teeth. The first stage of periodontal disease is gingivitis. At this stage, no bone loss has occurred, and the tooth is firmly attached to the supporting structures.¬†
Treatment:¬†Jake needed a professional veterinary dental cleaning to remove the bacteria under his gum line. He was placed under general anesthesia so the procedure could be performed safely and effectively. X-rays were taken to fully evaluate his dental health status, and no bone loss was apparent. Jake‚Äôs prognosis is good since his condition was mild, but his owner was instructed to start brushing the dog‚Äôs teeth daily to keep his mouth healthy between yearly professional cleanings.",https://angelscampvetgroup.com/pet-dental-health-case-studies/," Ah, I see. Based on the information provided, it's possible that Jake may have developed a dental condition known as pyorrhea. Pyorrhea is a common condition in dogs, especially those with heavy teeth grinding or chewing habits. It occurs when the gums become inflamed and bleed easily, which can cause bad breath and traces of blood on chew toys.

As Jake's primary care veterinarian, it's important to evaluate the extent of the pyorrhea and determine the underlying cause. A thorough dental examination, including radiographs (x-rays), may be necessary to identify any underlying dental problems, such as abscesses or calculus (tartar buildup) on the teeth.

Treatment for pyorrhea typically involves a combination of professional dental cleaning and management of any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the disease. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help control inflammation and promote healing.

In addition to addressing the dental issue, it's important to monitor Jake's oral health regularly to prevent the development of future problems. This may involve regular check-ups with your veterinarian, as well as proper home care such as brushing Jake's teeth regularly and providing a balanced diet that promotes good oral health.

Overall, while pyorrhea can be a concerning condition, it's important to address it promptly to prevent complications and ensure that Jake stays in good oral health.

Based on the symptoms described for Jake, it sounds like he may be suffering from periodontal disease, a common dental condition in dogs. Periodontal disease occurs when bacteria in the mouth form plaque and tartar on the teeth, leading to inflammation and infection of the gums. This can result in bad breath (halitosis), swollen and bleeding gums, and in severe cases, tooth loss.

Here's how I would address Jake's condition:

Diagnostic Steps:
Dental Examination: A thorough examination of Jake's mouth is essential to assess the extent of periodontal disease. This may involve probing the gums for pockets of inflammation, checking for loose teeth, and evaluating the degree of tartar buildup on the teeth.
Dental X-rays: X-rays can reveal issues beneath the gum line, such as bone loss or abscesses, which may not be visible during a visual inspection.
Treatment Options:
Professional Dental Cleaning: If periodontal disease is confirmed, Jake will likely require a professional dental cleaning under general anesthesia. This procedure involves scaling to remove plaque and tartar from the teeth, as well as polishing to smooth the tooth surfaces and reduce the risk of plaque buildup.
Periodontal Therapy: In cases of advanced periodontal disease, additional treatments such as root planing (smoothing the root surfaces) or periodontal surgery may be necessary to address deep pockets of infection and promote gum healing.
Antibiotics: Depending on the severity of the infection, antibiotics may be prescribed to help control bacterial growth and reduce inflammation.
Home Dental Care: After professional cleaning, Jake's owner should implement a regular dental care routine at home, including brushing his teeth regularly with a pet-safe toothpaste, providing dental chews or toys to help remove plaque, and incorporating dental diets or water additives recommended by the veterinarian.
Follow-up and Monitoring:
Jake's owner should schedule regular follow-up appointments with the veterinarian to monitor his dental health and address any ongoing issues.
Routine dental cleanings may be recommended every 6-12 months to prevent recurrence of periodontal disease and maintain oral health.
Education for the Owner:
It's important for Jake's owner to understand the importance of dental care for his overall health and well-being. Educating her on proper dental hygiene practices and the signs of dental disease will empower her to take proactive steps to keep Jake's teeth and gums healthy.

Treatment:¬†Casey was placed under general anesthesia, and X-rays were taken, revealing a tooth root abscess and mild bone loss. The affected tooth was extracted, and the socket was irrigated using an antibiotic solution. While under general anesthesia, Casey received a complete dental cleaning. She was sent home on systemic antibiotics for one week, and her owner was instructed to bring Casey back in six months to evaluate her dental health status. Daily toothbrushing also was recommended.",https://angelscampvetgroup.com/pet-dental-health-case-studies/," Thank you for providing the details of Casey's condition. Based on the symptoms you've described, there are several possible causes for the swelling on her right side face and pain around her right upper canine tooth. Here are some potential explanations and their corresponding treatments:

1. Dental abscess: An abscess is a pocket of pus that forms in response to an infection in the teeth or gums. The inflammation and swelling on Casey's face could be caused by an abscess in her right upper canine tooth. Treatment may involve antibiotics, extraction of the affected tooth, and supportive care to manage pain and discomfort.
2. Tooth resorption: Tooth resorption is a common condition in cats where the tooth roots dissolve due to various reasons like dental trauma, gum disease, or genetic predisposition. The inflammation and swelling around Casey's right upper canine tooth could be caused by resorptive lesions. Treatment may involve extraction of the affected tooth, antibiotics, and supportive care.
3. Oral tumors: Benign or malignant tumors in the mouth can cause swelling, pain, and difficulty eating. Casey's symptoms could be caused by an oral tumor in her right upper canine tooth area. A biopsy and imaging studies may be necessary to diagnose the type of tumor and determine the best course of treatment.
4. Trauma: Casey may have experienced trauma to her face, such as a blow or bite, which could cause swelling and pain on the right side of her face. Treatment may involve supportive care and management of any underlying infections.
5. Systemic conditions: Certain systemic conditions like feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) can cause swelling in the face, especially around the eyes and mouth. Other possible causes include hyperthyroidism, hypertension, or autoimmune disorders.

It's essential to perform additional diagnostic tests, such as radiographs (x-rays), dental examination, and blood work, to determine the underlying cause of Casey's symptoms. Your veterinarian can recommend the appropriate diagnostic procedures based on Casey's individual needs.

In the meantime, you can provide supportive care to help manage Casey's discomfort. You can offer her a bland diet, administer anti-inflammatory medication, and keep her warm and comfortable. It's crucial to monitor her condition closely and report any changes to your veterinarian for further evaluation and treatment.

  
","Based on the symptoms described for Casey, the 14-year-old spayed domestic shorthair cat, the most likely diagnosis is a dental abscess, specifically associated with the right upper canine tooth. Here is a detailed step-by-step analysis and recommended approach for managing her condition:

Diagnosis
Oral Examination Findings: The inflammation and swelling around Casey's right upper canine tooth strongly suggest a dental abscess, which is a localized infection typically at the root of a tooth. The swelling on the face and the tearing of the right eye further support this, as the infection or its associated inflammatory response might be affecting nearby tissues and structures.
Potential Complications: Given Casey's age and the location of the swelling, we should also consider the potential for the infection to have spread, impacting the surrounding bone (osteomyelitis) or even involving the eye socket if left unchecked.
Diagnostic Steps
Dental X-rays: These are crucial to confirm the diagnosis of a dental abscess. X-rays can help evaluate the extent of any bone loss around the tooth root, the condition of the tooth, and whether there is any involvement of surrounding bone structures.
Blood Tests: Given Casey's age and the systemic implications of a chronic infection, a complete blood count and biochemistry profile would be advisable to assess her overall health status and to prepare for possible anesthesia.
Treatment Recommendations
Antibiotics: Starting Casey on a course of antibiotics aimed at common oral pathogens would be an immediate step to control the infection. Choices such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or clindamycin are typically effective pending culture and sensitivity results if deemed necessary.
Anti-inflammatory and Pain Medication: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) specifically formulated for cats (e.g., meloxicam) can be used to reduce inflammation and provide pain relief. However, renal function should be assessed before initiation due to potential adverse effects on kidneys in older cats.
Dental Surgery: The definitive treatment for a dental abscess is typically surgical intervention, including extraction of the affected tooth. This procedure would ideally be performed under general anesthesia with careful monitoring, especially considering Casey's age.
Supportive Care: Ensuring that Casey continues to eat is crucial. Offering palatable, soft food or warming up her food to enhance its aroma may encourage eating. Hydration should also be monitored and supported through subcutaneous fluids if necessary.
Follow-Up
Postoperative Care: Following tooth extraction, Casey's recovery should be closely monitored. This includes ensuring she is comfortable, managing her pain, and continuing antibiotics as prescribed.
Recheck Visits: Scheduled follow-up visits are important to assess healing, evaluate response to treatment, and adjust care plans as needed. Further dental care and regular health checks are advisable given her senior status.
Diet and Dental Care: Post-recovery, implementing a dental care routine with regular veterinary checks can help prevent future dental issues. Special diets designed for dental health may also be beneficial.
In conclusion, a comprehensive approach involving immediate medical treatment and planned dental surgery is recommended for Casey, with careful attention to her overall health status and comfort given her age.",0.336538872785488,0.4133845237576127,6.530127972477359e-79,0.0176834771901792,0.1284046692607004,0.1283255086071987,0.5386791229248047,0.6866053342819214
3,"Karl is a 5-year-old neutered greyhound. Karl‚Äôs owner was concerned because he wouldn‚Äôt allow his face to be touched, and he seemed to be ‚Äúeating funny.‚Äù Karl was also excessively salivating. On examination, Karl was sensitive to touch on the right side of his face and was reluctant to allow a thorough oral examination. The dog was sedated to make it easier to examine his mouth, and a lower molar on the right side of his mouth was found to be loose.",-,"As periodontal disease progresses to stage three, moderate bone loss can be seen on X-rays, and 25% to 50%of the tooth‚Äôs supporting structures are lost. Breeds such as greyhounds, who have sleek, narrow skulls, are especially at risk because they have less bone mass to support their teeth.
Treatment:¬†Once Karl was under general anesthesia, X-rays were taken, which showed moderate bone loss and deterioration of the affected tooth root. The tooth was removed, and Karl received a thorough dental cleaning. Karl was sent home on a two-week course of systemic antibiotics, and scheduled for a recheck in three months to assess his progress. His owner also was instructed to begin daily toothbrushing.",https://angelscampvetgroup.com/pet-dental-health-case-studies/,"Thank you for providing me with the details of Karl's case. Based on the information provided, there are several possible explanations for Karl's symptoms.

Firstly, Karl's aversion to having his face touched could be due to a history of trauma or pain in that area. It is not uncommon for dogs to develop sensitivities or phobias after experiencing pain or discomfort in a particular location. If Karl has been touching his face excessively, it may indicate that he is trying to self-soothe or alleviate some discomfort.

Secondly, the ""eating funny"" behavior could be indicative of dental problems. Dogs with loose teeth or other dental issues may have difficulty chewing and eating their food properly, which can lead to abnormal chewing patterns. If Karl is experiencing discomfort while eating, it could explain why he is salivating excessively.

The reluctance to allow a thorough oral examination may be due to Karl's sensitivity to touch on the right side of his face. As you mentioned, sedation was necessary to complete the examination, which suggests that Karl may have been uncomfortable with the procedure.

Based on the information provided, it is possible that Karl has a dental issue, such as a loose tooth or gum disease, which could be causing his discomfort and sensitivity. However, without further examination and diagnostic testing, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of Karl's symptoms.

I would recommend that you consult with a veterinarian for a thorough examination and diagnosis. The veterinarian can perform additional tests, such as X-rays or blood work, to rule out other potential causes of Karl's symptoms. Based on the results of the examination and diagnostic tests, the veterinarian can provide recommendations for treatment and management of any underlying issues.
","The symptoms Karl is experiencing suggest a dental issue, likely involving the affected molar. In greyhounds, dental problems can be common due to their generally poor dental health, which is often a consequence of their previous diets and the anatomical structure of their mouths. Here is a step-by-step analysis and recommendation for Karl's case:

1. Diagnosis
The key symptoms — reluctance to have his face touched, eating abnormally, and excessive salivation — are typical signs of oral pain or discomfort. The discovery of a loose lower molar confirms that Karl is likely suffering from dental disease, possibly periodontal disease, which is inflammation of the structures around the teeth. In severe cases, it can lead to tooth mobility or loss.

2. Immediate Care
Since Karl's molar is loose, the immediate concern is to address any pain and prevent infection. Management would typically involve:

Pain management: Administering an appropriate analgesic to relieve pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) formulated for dogs can be used, but always under veterinary supervision to avoid side effects, particularly in greyhounds who can be sensitive to certain medications.
Antibiotics: If there is evidence of infection, such as gum swelling, pus, or bleeding, antibiotics may be prescribed to combat bacterial infection.
3. Dental Treatment
The treatment of a loose tooth in dogs generally involves extraction, especially if the tooth is significantly mobile and there is evidence of periodontal disease. This would be performed under general anesthesia:

Pre-anesthetic tests: Given that Karl is a greyhound, particular attention should be paid to the selection of anesthetic drugs and monitoring, as greyhounds have different metabolic pathways and lower body fat percentages affecting drug distribution and elimination.
Tooth extraction: The procedure should be carried out by a veterinarian experienced in dental surgeries. Post-operative care will include pain management and possibly a soft food diet during the recovery phase.
4. Follow-up Care
Post-extraction, Karl would require:

Dental hygiene: Implementation of a dental care routine including regular brushing with dog-safe toothpaste and possibly dental chews that help reduce plaque buildup.
Regular veterinary check-ups: Monitoring of healing post-extraction and regular check-ups to assess overall dental health and prevent future",0.3180732988228791,0.3057454318202273,3.6014102860819826e-155,7.731382519043338e-79,0.1065375302663438,0.1120331950207468,0.5569517612457275,0.7417590022087097
4,"Dolly was a 14-year-old spayed female Chihuahua. Her owner brought her in for an examination because the dog was unable to eat and had a persistently open mouth. Her owner said the dog had had a decreased appetite for about a week, but the open mouth occurred the day of the veterinary visit. An examination revealed Dolly had an elevated temperature, and her lower jaw appeared fractured. Blood work showed an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection, and elevated kidney values.¬†",-,"When periodontal disease becomes advanced, severe bone loss can occur and more than 50% of the tooth‚Äôs supporting structures are lost. Toy breeds, such as Chihuahuas, are at risk for jaw fractures because the roots of their teeth are so close to the edges of their jawbones. In addition to the damage done by the fracture, bacteria can enter the pet‚Äôs bloodstream, causing damage to organs throughout their body, including the kidneys, liver, and heart.¬†
Treatment:¬†Dolly was placed on intravenous fluids to help correct her increased kidney values, and X-rays were taken to assess the extent of her fractured jaw. Sadly, the X-rays revealed extensive bone loss, and her mandible was too damaged and fragile to repair surgically. Dolly‚Äôs owners elected to euthanize her to save her further pain.",https://angelscampvetgroup.com/pet-dental-health-case-studies/," Thank you for sharing the details of Dolly's case with me. Based on the symptoms you've provided, it sounds like Dolly may be experiencing a condition called ""dysphagia,"" which is difficulty swallowing. Dysphagia can be caused by a variety of factors, including oral cavity problems, esophageal disorders, and neurological conditions.

Dolly's elevated temperature and open mouth are both common symptoms of dysphagia, as well as other conditions like respiratory infections or dental problems. However, the elevated white blood cell count and kidney values you mentioned suggest that Dolly may have an underlying infection or kidney disease, which could be causing her dysphagia.

It's important to rule out any other potential causes of Dolly's symptoms, such as a foreign body obstruction or a respiratory infection. A thorough physical examination, including imaging studies like radiographs (x-rays) or an endoscopy, will be necessary to determine the underlying cause of Dolly's dysphagia.

In terms of treatment, depending on the underlying cause of Dolly's dysphagia, treatment may include antibiotics for an infection, pain management medication, or surgery to repair any structural problems. In some cases, a feeding tube may be necessary to help Dolly eat and maintain her nutrition until the underlying condition improves.

It's important to work closely with your veterinarian to determine the best course of treatment for Dolly based on her specific symptoms and medical history. With appropriate care and management, it is possible to help Dolly recover from her dysphagia and return to a normal diet.
","
Dolly's clinical presentation and findings from the examination and blood work suggest a multifaceted issue that requires a detailed approach to both diagnosis and management. Here’s how to proceed with her case:

Differential Diagnoses
Jaw Fracture: The inability to close the mouth and the appearance of a fractured jaw are concerning. Jaw fractures in small breed, older dogs can occur due to trauma or more commonly, as a result of underlying dental disease leading to bone weakening.
Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and fever indicate an infection. This could be secondary to the jaw fracture, where bone and adjacent soft tissues get infected, or it could be related to a severe dental infection.
Renal Disease: Elevated kidney values in a senior dog raise concerns about acute or chronic renal failure. This might be an independent issue or could be complicated by dehydration or an infection.
Dental Disease: Given her age and breed, significant dental disease could be underlying and exacerbating her current condition, contributing to both the fracture and the infection.
Diagnostic Approach
Radiography: Dental and skull radiographs are essential to confirm the jaw fracture and assess its extent. This will also help evaluate the status of her dental health and identify any lesions in the bone that might suggest a pathological fracture.
Further Blood Work: Assessing electrolytes and a urinalysis would help gauge kidney function more precisely and check for other metabolic disturbances.
Culturing and Sensitivity Tests: If there is discharge or deep infection suspected at the site of the fracture or in the oral cavity, obtaining a sample for culturing could guide effective antibiotic therapy.
Ultrasound or Additional Imaging: Depending on the results from the radiographs and initial kidney tests, an abdominal ultrasound might be necessary to further investigate the renal abnormalities.
Treatment Plan
Managing the Fracture: If the fracture is confirmed and depending on its severity, surgical intervention might be required to stabilize the jaw. For less severe or non-displaced fractures, conservative management with a jaw-supporting bandage and restricted diet (soft or liquid) might be sufficient.
Antibiotic Therapy: Starting broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial, given the signs of infection. This can be adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results later.
Supportive Care for Renal Disease: Fluid therapy to address dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalances is necessary. Based on further assessment of renal function, specific renal support medications or diet modifications might be required.
Pain Management: Pain relief is critical, considering the probable pain from both the fracture and any dental disease. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used cautiously considering her renal status; alternatives like opioids or gabapentin might be preferred.
Monitoring and Follow-Up
Regular follow-up to monitor the healing of the fracture, the response to the antibiotic therapy, and the status of renal function is crucial. Adjustments to the treatment plan should be based on her clinical progress and any new findings from ongoing diagnostics.

This comprehensive approach addresses both the immediate concerns of infection and fracture management, and the broader need for supportive care due to her age and renal status. Each step should be taken with careful consideration of her overall health and the potential risks and benefits of treatment options.",0.2870156452782121,0.365177747791009,8.614785406446009e-79,5.890996049096782e-79,0.1388174807197943,0.1160714285714285,0.4957897365093231,0.7154436111450195

The image shows a swollen right pelvic limb and thigh, with subcutaneous hemorrhaging noted in the affected area. The general condition of the dog appears good, with no signs of gastrointestinal distress.

The white blood cell count is normal, with no decrease in platelet count, which suggests that the swelling may not be caused by an infection or immune-mediated disease. The blood smear analysis did not reveal any abnormal cells, which eliminates the possibility of a blood-borne tumor.

The biochemical test results showed elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, indicative of increased bone metabolism. This finding is consistent with the presence of a bone lesion, such as a benign or malignant tumor. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed a large number of mast cells in the stifle joint, which may indicate an inflammatory response to the swelling.

Computed tomography (CT) scanning showed no evidence of metastasis to the intra-abdominal or other organs, but the cortex of the femur and tibia near the affected joint is thinning, and in some places, the cortex has fractured, and soft tissues have infiltrated into the bone. This suggests the presence of a bone tumor, such as osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma, which can cause bone destruction and joint deformity.

Based on these findings, I would recommend further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or positron emission tomography [PET]) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the swelling. Additionally, a biopsy may be necessary to determine the nature of the bone lesion and guide treatment decisions.
  
","The information provided in the case of the 13-year-old female Shiba Inu dog, along with the cytological findings from the fine-needle aspiration (FNA), strongly suggests a diagnosis of mast cell tumor (MCT) affecting the stifle joint and possibly involving the adjacent femur and tibia. Here's a detailed analysis and the implications of the findings:

Clinical Presentation and History: The dog's symptoms, including limb elevation, thigh swelling, and subcutaneous hemorrhaging without systemic symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea, point towards a localized issue rather than a systemic one.
Laboratory Findings:
White Blood Cell Count: Normal values indicate no systemic infection or inflammation.
Platelet Count: Normal levels, which is important since thrombocytopenia can sometimes accompany mast cell tumors due to the release of heparin from mast cells.
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Elevation: This is significant as it suggests increased bone metabolism. In the context of a mast cell tumor, this could be due to the local effects of the tumor on bone tissue, possibly through factors released by the mast cells that affect bone resorption or formation.
Cytology and Imaging:
Cytology: The presence of numerous large granular mast cells in the FNA samples from the stifle is indicative of a mast cell tumor. Mast cells typically release histamine, heparin, and other substances that can cause local tissue damage and pain, which might explain the clinical signs.
Computed Tomography (CT): The absence of visible spread to intra-abdominal or other organs is a positive sign indicating that the MCT might be localized. However, the thinning and fracturing of the cortex of the femur and tibia are concerning, as they suggest aggressive local invasion by the tumor, possibly leading to secondary pathological fractures.
Diagnosis: The diagnosis likely points to a locally invasive mast cell tumor with significant impact on the bone integrity near the stifle joint.
Management and Treatment Options:
Surgical Intervention: Considering the local bone involvement, surgical removal of the tumor, if feasible, would be the primary treatment option. Complete excision can be challenging but is crucial for controlling the local disease.
Radiation Therapy: Post-surgical radiation may be considered to manage any residual tumor cells and help prevent recurrence, especially due to the bone involvement.
Medical Management: Depending on the systemic symptoms and the histological grade of the tumor (once biopsied and confirmed), medications such as corticosteroids to control inflammation and drugs to stabilize mast cell degranulation (e.g., oclacitinib, antihistamines) might be used.
Pain Management: Given the bone involvement and potential for discomfort, appropriate analgesics should be considered to ensure the dog's quality of life.
Follow-Up and Monitoring: Regular follow-ups will be essential to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment, manage any complications, and check for signs of metastasis or recurrence.
In summary, this case requires a coordinated approach involving surgical, medical, and supportive therapies to manage a potentially complex mast cell tumor with significant local bone involvement.",0.1034551152739234,0.0935776282200921,3.7413322369833415e-155,3.4471153149985987e-155,0.1020408163265306,0.0776978417266187,0.3218790292739868,0.24157725274562836

Paracetamol (10 mg/kg; 10 mg/mL, Parac-etamol, B. Braun) and meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg; 5 mg/mL,Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim) were given for analgesia.Hartmann‚Äôs solution was administered at 5 mL/kg/h through-out the anaesthetic and 20 mg/kg cefuroxime (750 mg/vial,Zinacef, GalaxoSmithKline) given every 90 minutes. Retro-grade intubation was performed similar to the techniquedescribed by Vieitez et al.22A wide-bore intravenous catheterwas placed into the trachea from the ventral midline neck, aguide wire fed through this catheter to exit the right side ofthe mouth and the endotracheal tube threaded over the guidewire. Total intravenous anaesthesia was continued with 100%oxygen delivered via the endotracheal tube. The left side of theface and right mandible were clipped and aseptically prepared.An ultrasound-guided trigeminal nerve block via the left tem-poral approach was performed using 1.5 mL (0.1 mL/craniallength) bupivacaine (5 mg/mL, Marcain Polyamp Steripac0.5%, AspenZeneca). A skin incision was made along the ven-tral aspect of the zygomatic arch, and the masseter musclewas elevated and reflected ventrally. Ankylosis between theremodelled zygomatic arch and mandible was identified andthe lateral aspect of the TMJ located (Figure3). The ankylosed bone along the rostrolateral aspect of the vertical ramus of the mandible and ventromedial. aspect of the remodelled zygoma were resected using a pneumatic surgical drill (Minos,Hall, Conmed Linvatec, FL, USA) with 4.0-mm medium car-bide burr and built-in irrigation (Figure4). The fibrous tissueon the rostral aspect of the TMJ was incised. Mild haem-orrhage from the transverse facial vein occurred and wascontrolled using diathermy. Manipulation of the mandible andmaxilla resulted in a 5-cm incisal gap. The surgical site waslavaged with sterile saline and the masseter reattached to theperiosteum reflected dorsally on the zygomatic arch using 2metric polydioxanone (PDS+, Ethicon) in a horizontal mat-tress pattern. The subcutaneous tissue layers were closed in asimple continuous pattern with 2 metric polydioxanone, andthe skin was closed with 2 metric poliglecaprone (Monocryl,Ethicon) in an intradermal pattern followed by skin glue (Der-mabond, Ethicon). Methadone, paracetamol and meloxicamwere continued post-operatively, with fluid therapy given (at2 mL/kg/h) until the dog was eating.",https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/vrc2.583,"Based on the CT scan images provided, there are a few key features that stand out. The left temporomandibular joint (TMJ) appears to be congruent, but there are some abnormalities in the surrounding bone structure. Both the mandibular fossa of the left temporal bone and the condyloid process of the left mandibular bone have a slight flattening and undulation in their configuration. Additionally, there is a blunting of the left retro-articular process relative to the contralateral side.

Moving on to the maxilla, there is malformation of the caudal right maxillary bone with severe sclerosis and thickening of the right maxillary zygomatic process. This results in an overcrowding of the left maxillary molar teeth with buccal displacement of the rostral mandibular premolar teeth bilaterally up to 12 mm from the mandibular midline.

In conclusion, based on these observations, it seems that there is a complex issue affecting the TMJ and surrounding bone structure on the left side of the dog's face. Further examination and consultation with an orthopedic specialist are necessary to determine the best course of treatment for this case.
  
","The clinical presentation and CT findings for this 1-year-old male Lurcher indicate a complex set of craniofacial abnormalities likely contributing to the dog's inability to open its mouth and the deviation of the muzzle. Here's an analysis of the key findings and possible implications:

Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Abnormalities:
The left TMJ shows some congruency, but the mandibular fossa and condyloid process are slightly flattened and undulating. This suggests chronic changes, possibly from a developmental disorder or less likely from a subtle, unrecognized trauma. The blunting of the left retro-articular process relative to the contralateral side could indicate some degenerative changes affecting joint mobility.
Bone Proliferation and Bridging:
Proliferative new bone on the left mandibular ramus forming a bridge with the rostral aspect of the zygomatic bone and zygomatic process of the left maxilla is highly suggestive of an exostosis or bony proliferation. This abnormal growth could physically restrict the opening of the jaw by mechanical blocking or by fusion of normally movable parts.
Malformation and Sclerosis:
Severe sclerosis and thickening of the right maxillary zygomatic process, and malformation of the caudal right maxillary bone, indicate additional structural changes that could further affect the facial symmetry and function. This also hints at a possible underlying developmental or bone remodeling disorder.
Asymmetry and Deviation:
The left TMJ is rostrally located relative to the right, which leads to an apparent foreshortening of the left mandible. This, along with the left-sided deviation of both maxillae, nasal cavities, and nasal septum, contributes to the facial asymmetry observed clinically.
Dental Malocclusion:
Overcrowding of the left maxillary molar teeth and buccal displacement of the rostral mandibular premolar teeth indicates significant malocclusion. This not only affects the dog's ability to chew and close its mouth properly but could also contribute to ongoing discomfort and altered bite dynamics.
Differential Diagnoses:
Congenital developmental disorder: Given the onset from a young age and no trauma history, a congenital issue seems likely.
Osteochondrodysplasia or a similar bone development disorder: The structural and proliferative bone changes could point to a disorder in the bone development and growth pathways.
Chronic osteomyelitis: Less likely given the lack of reaction to palpation and other inflammatory signs, but could be considered if infection markers are elevated.
Recommended Management:
Surgical consultation: To evaluate the feasibility of surgically correcting some of the bone deformities or removing obstructive proliferative bone to improve jaw mobility.
Pain management: Chronic pain is likely a concern due to malocclusion and joint abnormalities.
Nutritional support: Ensuring the dog can eat adequately with its current jaw limitations, possibly with modified diet forms like wet food or pate.
Regular monitoring: Continued evaluation to monitor progression of the condition and adjust care as needed.
Further diagnostic steps might include detailed blood work to rule out any underlying metabolic or systemic disorders that could contribute to abnormal bone growth or degeneration.",0.2483680192951979,0.2646801156647057,0.0113993046083333,0.0272257446399263,0.1274509803921568,0.1342134213421342,0.17869439721107483,0.1084357500076294
7,"A  12-  year-  old,  17-  kg,  female  neutered  Poodle  mix  dog  was  presented  for  coughing,  snoring,  exercise  intolerance  and  lethargy.  The  owner  had  noticed  that  the  dog  made  gasping  sounds  associated  with  eating. The symptoms were noticed 2 months prior to  the  presentation,  but  the  owner  did  not  seek  veterinary  advice  due  to  financial  constraints.  He  mentioned that he had administered antibiotics and steroids to the dog, following information found on the internet.On  presentation,  physical  examination  revealed  tachypnoea  (panting),  normal  heart  rate  and  body  temperature. During the examination, the dog was bright,  alert,  but  had  a  constant  inspiratory  and  expiratory  rattling  noise.  A  non-  painful  ventral  neck   mass,   approximately   3.32   cm√ó7.12   cm   in   dimension, was seen on the right ventral side of the cervical  region  compressing  the  trachea  (figure  1). The  overlying  skin  was  normal.  During  the  palpa-tion  of  the  trachea,  coughing  was  easily  elicited.  The  cough  was  harsh,  sonorous  and  terminated  in  retching. Oral examination revealed mild inflam-mation  of  the  gingival  attachments  and  plaque  covering  molars  and  premolars.  The  tonsils  and  the  lymph  nodes  of  the  area  (mandibular,  pres-capular) were of normal size and consistency. The dog‚Äôs BCS was 9 (17 kg). Based on the history and clinical examination findings, thoracic radiographs and  ultrasonographic  examination  of  the  mass  were proposed to confirm the origin of the mass along  with  concurrent  heart  or  lung  pathology.  In  addition,  general  blood  and  serum  tests  were  suggested as part of a pre- anaesthetic work- up to assess the patient‚Äôs overall health.
The  general  blood  profile  and  serum  analysis  were unremarkable. Serum concentrations of T4fT4 and TSH were within normal limits. The dog was serolog-ical  negative  for  Dirofilaria  immitis  and  Leishmania  infantum. Imaging tests were done without sedation. Thoracic radiography revealed a bronchial pattern, excessive bronchial wall thickening and peribronchial infiltration. There was evidence of right- sided cardiomegaly  and  pulmonary  hypertension,  as  a  consequence  of  chronic  airway  disease.  Cervical  radiographic  examination  was  not  performed  at  that  time.  Ultrasonographic  examina-tion  of  the  mass  was  performed  with  a  7.5-  MHz  curvilinear  transducer  since  no  higher  frequency  transducer  was  available.  Findings  presented  a  well-  defined  cystic  lesion  with  thin  walls  and hypoechoic lesions, without internal vascularity, filled with hypoechoic fluid (figure 2A,B).Aspiration of the cyst was performed and 5 mL of thick, sero-sanguinous  mucinous  fluid  was  aspirated.  Fine-  needle  aspira-tion of the right mandibular lymph node revealed inflammatory infiltration.Because  incisional  biopsy  and  computed  tomographic  exam-ination  were  proposed  but  declined  by  the  owner,  a  postoper-ative  histopathology  examination  of  the  mass  confirmed  the  diagnosis  of  thyroglossal  duct  cyst.  The  description  mentioned  an  outer  connective  tissue  wall  infiltrated  with  inflammatory  cells  along  with  an  inner  cystic  wall  consisted  of  islands  made  from thyroid follicles, surrounded by cuboidal cells.",Image Case 7,"The animal was premedicated with acetylopromazine (Aceprom-azine;  Alfasan,  Netherlands  B.V.)  0.05  mg/kg  combined  with  butorphanol  (Dolorex;  Msd,  UK)  0.1  mg/kg  intramuscularly.  Induction  of  general  anaesthesia  was  achieved  using  propofol  (Propofol;  Fresenius  Kabi,  Hellas)  2  mg/kg  intravenously  and  after  endotracheal  intubation  was  maintained  with  isoflurane  (Isofluran; Abbott, USA) delivered in oxygen.The dog was positioned in dorsal recumbency. A midline inci-sion was performed using a scalpel blade no. 10 from the caudal submandibular region to the distal third of the cervical trachea. After the transection of sternohyoid muscles, the cyst was iden-tified  as  a  multilocular  thin-  walled  structure,  full  of  mucinous  fluid.  Blunt  and  sharp  dissection  of  the  loose  connective  tissue  was  used  in  order  to  free  the  mass  from  surrounding  tissues.  There was mild bleeding which was controlled with pressure and electrocautery. The closure of the surgical incision was done in three layers. The apposition of the muscles was done in a simple continuous  pattern  (Vicryl  2/0;  Ethicon,  USA).  The  connective  tissue  was  sutured  in  a  simple  continuous  pattern  (Vicryl  2/0;  Ethicon).The skin was closed in a simple interrupted pattern (Ethibond excel 3/0; Ethicon).Postoperatively,  the  dog  received  amoxicillin  with  clavulanic  acid (Synulox; Pfizer, Italy) 22 mg/kg every 12 hours for 10 days and  carprofen  (Rimadyl;  Pfizer,  USA)  2  mg/kg  every  12  hours  for 4 days. Although the surgery was done in an aseptic manner, we decided to prescribe antibiotic treatment until receiving the histopathology  results,  10  days  later,  as  the  abscess  was  still  in  our differential diagnosis. In addition to that, we considered the concurrent  chronic  bronchitis  with  possible  respiratory  infec-tion, the concurrent gingivitis, the dog‚Äôs old age, BCS of 9, the seroma  formation,  the  use  of  electrocautery,  and  the  wrongful  administration  of  antibiotics  and  steroids  from  the  owner  as  further  predisposing  factors  for  infection.  The  dog‚Äôs  recovery  was  uneventful  except  for  a  seroma  formation  and  she  was  discharged on the second postoperative day.At  2  weeks  postoperatively,  treatment  was  also  administered  for  chronic  bronchitis.  Oral  prednisolone  (Prezolon;  Takeda  Hellas  AE)  0.5  mg/kg  every  12  hours  initially  was  given  for  1 week and then tapered off over the next 3 weeks. Also, salbu-tamol (Asthmotrat; Intermed A.B.E.E., Hellas) 0.05 mg/kg every 12 hours and doxycycline (Vibramycin; Pfizer Hellas) 10 mg/kg once a day were administered for 6 weeks",https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1136/vetreccr-2019-000996," Thank you for sharing the case report with me! Based on the imaging findings described in the passage, I can identify several key features of the mass observed in the dog's neck.

Firstly, the image shows a well-defined cystic lesion with thin walls and hypoechoic lesions, indicating that the mass is likely a thyroglossal duct cyst. The absence of internal vascularity within the cyst also supports this diagnosis.

Secondly, the image reveals inflammatory infiltration in the right mandibular lymph node, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation in the dog's neck region.

Lastly, the description mentions that the mass was aspirated, and 5 mL of thick, sero-sanguinous mucinous fluid was obtained. This finding is consistent with the diagnosis of a thyroglossal duct cyst, as these types of cysts are known to fill with fluid.

In conclusion, based on the imaging findings described in the passage, it appears that the dog has a thyroglossal duct cyst in its neck, likely caused by chronic airway disease, and there is also evidence of inflammation in the right mandibular lymph node. Further diagnostic tests and examinations may be necessary to confirm these findings and determine the best course of treatment for the dog. As always, I recommend consulting with a veterinarian for professional medical advice.
  
","
The ultrasound images you provided show two distinct measurements of what appears to be a cystic structure, characterized by hypoechoic (dark on ultrasound) fluid content, with a well-defined boundary and thin walls, as described in the history of the patient. These characteristics are typical for a cystic lesion, and in this context, a thyroglossal duct cyst as diagnosed is consistent with these ultrasound findings.

For a 12-year-old Poodle mix presenting with respiratory symptoms including coughing, snoring, and lethargy, combined with a visible and palpable ventral neck mass, the discovery and subsequent diagnostic analysis of this cystic lesion provide significant clinical insights:

Localization and Effects: The mass, located in the cervical region and compressing the trachea, is likely contributing significantly to the respiratory symptoms observed. Tracheal compression can lead to difficulty breathing, which manifests as snoring, coughing, and exercise intolerance.
Ultrasound Imaging: The imaging in Figure A and B shows dimensions of the mass and its internal characteristics. The lack of internal vascularity within the lesion on ultrasound imaging further supports the diagnosis of a benign cyst rather than a vascularized tumor.
Pathology and Surgical Considerations: Given the confirmation of a thyroglossal duct cyst, surgical removal is typically the recommended treatment to alleviate symptoms and prevent potential complications such as infection or further growth. However, the owner declined further diagnostic and surgical interventions.
Management and Treatment: In the absence of surgical treatment, managing the patient's symptoms is critical. Monitoring the mass for changes in size or character and managing respiratory symptoms with appropriate medications based on veterinary guidance would be necessary. Additionally, addressing the chronic airway disease and cardiac issues with medications to manage pulmonary hypertension and support cardiac function would also be vital.
Long-term Monitoring: Regular follow-ups to monitor the mass's size and any potential respiratory compromise are crucial, especially given the dog's age and concurrent health issues.
This case emphasizes the importance of thorough diagnostic workup, including imaging and cytology, to appropriately diagnose and manage complex conditions in veterinary patients.",0.3032240438944538,0.2611525513445042,2.484066401306948e-155,4.217556263726601e-155,0.1417069243156199,0.1397849462365591,0.5513930916786194,0.45190078020095825
8,"Case A was a 6-month-old, female, spayed Shih tzu/Yorkshire terrier mixed breed dog. The owners noted a swelling under the dog‚Äôs tongue at 3 months of age. At that time, the referring veterinarian reported a blue, fluctuant, non-painful, soft tissue swelling under the right rostral aspect of the tongue, which extended from the region of the right mandibular canine tooth to the distal aspect of the right mandibular first premolar This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

At 6 months of age, the referring veterinarian performed an oral examination under general anesthesia and skull radiographs, coinciding with ovariohysterectomy and umbilical hernia repair. Fine-needle aspiration of the swelling was performed, which revealed a black to brown fluid similar to what has been described in the literature.2 Unfortunately, the cytologic sample was not of diagnostic value. The patient was referred to the Dentistry and Oral Surgery Service at Iowa State University Lloyd Veterinary Medical Center for further evaluation. On conscious oral examination, the patient was found to have a class 4 malocclusion. There was a 4 √ó 2 √ó 2 cm, round, non-painful, non-mobile soft tissue swelling under the right side of the tongue at the rostral aspect of the right mandible. There was no clinical evidence of a right mandibular canine tooth. The patient also appeared to be missing several mandibular incisor teeth.",Image Case 8,"The patient was premedicated and induced for general anaesthesia (dexmedetomidine 0.0025 mg/kg intravenously [IV], hydromorphone 0.1 mg/kg IV, propofol 5 mg/kg IV), intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube and maintained on 1.5%‚Äì2.5% isoflurane anaesthesia to maintain appropriate anaesthetic depth. An anaesthetised oral examination including full-mouth intraoral radiographs revealed an unerupted right mandibular second incisor tooth and right mandibular canine tooth (402, 404), as well as a persistent deciduous right mandibular second incisor tooth and right mandibular canine tooth (802, 804). There was a radiolucent bony expansion in the right rostral mandible, with minimal alveolar bone supporting the erupted right mandibular first and third permanent incisors (401, 403) and deciduous second incisor (802), and the unerupted right mandibular second incisor and right mandibular canine tooth (402, 404) (Figure 1a). The right mandibular second premolar (406) and the left and right mandibular third molars (311, 411) were clinically and radiographically absent. There were round radiolucent opacities in the pulp cavity of the right mandibular first molar tooth (409), which appeared consistent with the radiographic appearance of pulp stones. The patient was placed in sternal recumbency for computed tomography of the head through the third cervical vertebrae. The patient was then given iohexol (400 mgI/kg IV; Omnpaque 240 positive contrast, Nycomed) for a positive contrast computed tomography scan. The scan revealed an expansive soft tissue attenuating, non-contrast enhancing structure with thin smooth cortical margins in the region of the right rostral mandible. There was minimal alveolar bone on the lingual aspect of the right mandibular first incisor to the canine tooth (401 to 404) (Figure 1b). The patient had six teeth extracted, which included the right mandibular first, second and third incisors, right mandibular canine tooth and the persistent deciduous right mandibular second incisor and canine tooth (401, 402, 403, 404, 802, 804). These teeth were extracted due to the intimate association with the suspected dentigerous cyst formation and concern for loss of alveolar bone support, as well as significant clinical mobility of the teeth. Bilateral caudal inferior alveolar nerve blocks were placed with 0.5 mg of bupivacaine per quadrant to provide regional anaesthesia to the surgical sites. A mucoperiosteal flap was created to facilitate tooth extraction. The mucosa was reflected with a periosteal elevator. Lagrange scissors, a periosteal elevator and a Miller‚Äôs surgical curette were used to remove the capsule lining encompassing the cyst. The cavity was flushed with 0.9% sterile saline. The surgical flaps were closed with a 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture material in a simple interrupted suture pattern. Post-operative radiographs were performed showing complete extraction of the teeth and no obvious evidence of retained tooth roots, as well as no evidence of an iatrogenic mandibular fracture (Figure 1c). The teeth, capsule lining and samples of the alveolar bone were submitted for a histopathologic diagnosis. Histopathologically, the diagnosis was determined to be an odontogenic cyst, with further classification as a dentigerous cyst associated with the impacted right mandibular canine tooth (404). Radiographically, this tooth showed evidence of arrested tooth development compared to the surrounding teeth. The patient underwent a computed tomography scan of the skull 7 months following treatment, which showed osseus remodelling of the right rostral mandible and no evidence of cyst recurrence",https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/vrc2.652," Based on the information provided, there are several features that can be observed in the image of Case A:

1. Soft tissue swelling: A non-painful, non-mobile soft tissue swelling is visible under the right side of the tongue at the rostral aspect of the right mandible. The swelling measures approximately 4 cm in length, 2 cm in width, and 2 cm in height.
2. Right mandibular canine tooth absence: There is no clinical evidence of a right mandibular canine tooth. This suggests that the patient may have a congenital absence of this tooth.
3. Missing mandibular incisor teeth: The patient appears to be missing several mandibular incisor teeth, which could be due to genetic anomalies or trauma.
4. Malocclusion: The patient has a class 4 malocclusion, which indicates that the upper and lower teeth do not meet properly, resulting in an uneven bite. This can lead to dental problems such as tooth wear, gum disease, and jaw pain.
5. Swelling color: The swelling is described as black to brown in fluid, similar to what has been reported in the literature. This could indicate inflammation or infection within the swelling.

Based on these findings, it seems that Case A may have a combination of dental and soft tissue abnormalities, which require further evaluation and treatment by a veterinary dentist or oral surgeon. It is important to verify all medical information with official sources, such as peer-reviewed journals or reputable veterinary organizations, to ensure the most accurate diagnosis and treatment plan for the patient.  
","The images you've provided appear to show radiographs of a canine skull, specifically focusing on different views of the mandible and possibly surrounding structures. Given the case description of the 6-month-old Shih Tzu/Yorkshire terrier mix, the images likely aim to assess the bony structures related to the described oral issues.

Image Analysis:
Image (a) likely represents a dorsoventral (DV) view of the mandible. This view allows for the assessment of the overall symmetry of the mandible and the presence of any bony lesions or abnormalities in dental alignment or structure.
Image (b) appears to be a sagittal section possibly from computed tomography (CT), providing a detailed look at the internal structure of the skull and the teeth in one half of the mandible. This type of imaging is beneficial for evaluating the depth of lesions or structural abnormalities not clearly visible on standard radiographs.
Image (c) is another DV view but focused on a different angle or perhaps after some treatment or progression of the condition, showing differences in the dental structure or other pathologies.
Specific Findings Related to the Case:
The absence of the right mandibular canine tooth as noted in the clinical history could potentially be visualized in these images, particularly in the detailed CT-like section where missing teeth would show a lack of tooth structure in the alveolar bone.
The swelling described under the tongue could be related to a developmental cyst or a tumor, which may not be directly visible on these radiographs unless there are secondary changes in the bone. Given the age and breed, developmental anomalies are a strong differential.
The presence of a class 4 malocclusion is consistent with what can be interpreted from these radiographs; misalignment might be evident, showing displacement or irregular positioning of the teeth.
Since there's mention of missing several mandibular incisor teeth, this could be verified if these images were clearer or annotated for specific teeth. This finding might indicate congenital absence or previous loss due to trauma or disease.
Recommended Next Steps:
Further Diagnostic Imaging: Advanced imaging like CT or MRI might be required to better visualize the extent of the soft tissue swelling and any potential impact on surrounding structures.
Biopsy of the Swelling: If not already done, a biopsy rather than a fine-needle aspiration could provide a definitive diagnosis to guide treatment.
Orthodontic Consultation: Given the malocclusion, consultation with a veterinary dental specialist might be necessary to determine if corrective measures are needed to improve the dog's bite and overall quality of life.
Regular Monitoring: Continued monitoring of the oral health and development, considering the dog's age and the presence of dental abnormalities.
The images are a critical component of diagnosing and planning the treatment for this patient, providing insights into the underlying bony structures and helping to map out any corrective surgeries or treatments needed.",0.4169888426596723,0.3745643623428623,0.0172220064425859,0.0339846527024431,0.1389578163771712,0.1610087293889427,0.6489391326904297,0.5204324722290039
