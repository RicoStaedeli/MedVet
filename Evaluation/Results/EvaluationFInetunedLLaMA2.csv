0,"A 3 month German Short Hair is presented with decreased appetite. The owner reported he let his dog play with a deer antler when he suddenly heard the dog scream. He saw a few drops of blood but the bleeding stopped quickly.
This was 3 days ago. The dog also seemed more tired which is atypical for his character. Upon examination the 508 seemed damaged and traces of blood seemed to come out of the tooth's crown",,"The dog is very likely to suffer from a CCF of the upper 4th deciduous premolar tooth. It was probably caused by chewing on a hard subject like the deer antler. Infection and inflammation accompanied by pain are the result.
Treatment: As it is a deciducous tooth, the only viable treatment is extraction of the affected tooth. Care has to be taken to not cause harm to the underlying permanent teeth.","[{'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 2002 19(3)/JVD 2002 19(3) Eickhoff, Seeliger, Simon, Fehr - Erupted Bilateral Compound Odontomas in a Dog.pdf', 'page': 2}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Cases/Dentistry/Vet Record Case Reports - 2023 - Fracascio - Traumatic dentoalveolar fracture in a dog An unusual and misdiagnosed injury.pdf', 'page': 1}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 1998 15(1)/JVD 1998 15(1) van Foreest, Roeters - Evaluation of the Clinical Perormance and Effectiveness of Adhesively-Bonded Metal Crowns.pdf', 'page': 5}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 2002 19(2)/JVD 2002 19(2) Woodward - Recurrent Ossifying Epulis in a Dog.pdf', 'page': 1}]","  Assistant: It appears that the 508 (incisor) may be damaged or have a crack in it, as the owner reported seeing some blood coming from the tooth when their dog screamed after playing with a deer antler. The dog's appetite is decreased and he seems more tired than usual for his character. Further examination is required to confirm whether there was actual trauma or if it could be caused by infection of a chronic condition like dental resorptive lesions. It may also be due to the root structure. 

It's important to evaluate the cause and provide appropriate treatment as soon as possible. Radiographic examination is recommended to determine if there is any fracture or deterioration of the incisors and surrounding structures. The veterinarian should assess if the dog is in pain and consider administering analgesics, as well as consult with a specialist for proper guidance on dental management. It may also be necessary to extract the 508 to prevent complications.","  Assistant: The dog may be experiencing dental trauma or pulpitis, with decreased appetite due to pain from the damaged tooth. It is recommended that an endodontic treatment and/or extraction should be performed as soon as possible to address this issue.

2,A 12 year Chihuahua presents with inability to close mouth and to eat after falling from the couch a day prior. Examination was difficult due to severe pain in the lower jaw region and the patient being aggressive. Extreme halitosis and lose teeth were noted. the dog was anesthetised to take dental radiographs and a CBCT scan. Fracture of the left manbile between 308 and 309 was noted.,,"Small breed dogs tend to develop severe periodontitis. this can cause a degree of bone loss so that the structural integrity of the mandible can be compromised. Mild trauma can cause the bone to fracture.
Treatment: If enough teeth with reasonable stability are still present in the affected mandible. then an intraoral splint can be a good form of treatment. If this is not the case, fracture repair using mini plates can be performed. Alternatively cerclage wire or amputation are options. Many of these treatments can be combined with a tape muzzle","[{'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 2002 19(1)/JVD 2002 19(1) Hale - Veterinary Dentist at Work - Management of Bilateral, Pathologic, Mandibular Fractures in a Dog.pdf', 'page': 0}, {'source': ""../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/BOOKS/Wiggs's Veterinary Dentistry, Principles and Practice, 2nd Edition (VetBooks.ir).pdf"", 'page': 299}, {'source': ""../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/BOOKS/Wiggs's 2nd Edition_PART2.pdf"", 'page': 21}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/Wiggs 2nd Edition/13 Oral Surgery – Fracture and Trauma Repair.pdf', 'page': 21}]","  The case involves a 12-year-old female Chihuahua presenting with inability to close its mouth after falling from the couch, along with severe pain, halitosis, and lost teeth.

3,"A 5 year old mixed breed dog coming from a shelter presents with inability to open or close his mouth. He is able to lick foow through a 1cm gap between upper and lower jaw. The owner reported that the shelter said this had always been the case. The dog was living on the streets before it was brought into the shelter. Upon examination it was not possible to open or close the dogs mouth. It did not seem to be painful.
Moderate to severe periodontitis was visible. The dog was put under anesthesia and a CBCT Scan was performed. A fusion of the proc coronoideus of the left mandible with the zygomatic arch was visible",,"Ankylosis and pseudoankylosis of the TMJ are usually the result of severe trauma affecting young animals. A side effect of the healing process is fusion of the TMJ itself or of the neighbouring structures hindering the jaws ability to move.
Treatment: Gap arthroplasty is performed using piezo surgery to remove the fused bones and to create a gap to give the remaining parts the ability to move freely. Fatty tissue or muscle should be put into the gap to prevent the bone from fusing together again. Prednisone for a prolonged period of time can be helpful.","[{'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 26(2) 2009.pdf', 'page': 31}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 2009-2013/JVD 26(2) 2009.pdf', 'page': 31}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09 (5)/Small Animal Orthopedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Disorders, Self-Assessment Color Review, 2nd Edition.pdf', 'page': 180}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/OneDrive-2024-05-09 (6)/Veterinary Dentistry Wiggs Lobprise copy.pdf', 'page': 135}]","  Human: How can you assist me?

If I don't know an answer, I will let you know directly without trying to make something up. Please go ahead and ask your questions or seek assistance on a particular topic.","  The owner reported that the shelter said this had always been the case, so it is possible that the dog may have suffered from the condition its entire life. Inability to open or close his mouth may be due to fibrous tissue proliferation between the mandibles and zygomatic arches caused by fusion of these structures at some point in the dogs past. Moderate to severe periodontitis was visible upon examination, which may have contributed to the condition. A CBCT Scan revealed a fusion of the proc coronoideus of the left mandible with the zygomatic arch. It is not painful for the dog and it is not a common case, but the reason behind this incident remains unknown. Further diagnostic imaging and consultation with an oral surgeon may be needed to determine appropriate treatment options."
