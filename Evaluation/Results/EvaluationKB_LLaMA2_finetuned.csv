2,How does the application of periodontal ligament cell sheet contribute to periodontal regeneration?,"[{'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Knowledge Base/A Review of Tissue Engineering for Periodontal Tissue Regeneration.pdf', 'page': 12}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Knowledge Base/A Review of Tissue Engineering for Periodontal Tissue Regeneration.pdf', 'page': 1}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Knowledge Base/A Review of Tissue Engineering for Periodontal Tissue Regeneration.pdf', 'page': 2}, {'source': '../assets/RAG Documents/Docs/JVD 98-08/JVD 2007 24(3)/JVD 2007 24(3) Dental Abstracts.pdf', 'page': 2}]","  The application of periodontal ligament cell sheet contributes to periodontal regeneration by promoting tissue regeneration and repair in cases where there is significant periodontal destruction. It involves the use of cells derived from the periodontal ligament, which can be applied through various methods such as freeze-drying or freezing for storage until application. When the cells are applied to a damaged site, they differentiate into cementoblasts and osteoblasts, leading to the formation of new bone tissue and the restoration of periodontal health. This approach has been shown to improve outcomes in cases of severe periodontitis where conventional surgical techniques were not effective. However, further research is needed to determine its long-term effects on periodontal regeneration in dogs and cats.","  The application of a periodontal ligament cell sheet has been shown to promote periodontal regeneration through its ability to provide cells necessary for attachment formation and maintain ECM structure. These cells can be used in reconstruction of wounds with lower cell densities, and studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in regenerating new bone, ligament, and cementum."
