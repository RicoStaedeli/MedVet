0,"Jake is a 3-year-old neutered German shepherd. His owner noticed that her pet’s breath was pretty smelly, and she also found traces of blood on his chew toys. She brought Jake in for his annual wellness visit and asked if she should be concerned about these issues. On examination, Jake’s gums were red and swollen, and bleeding in some areas. ",-,"Periodontal disease is present to some degree in most pets age 3 and older. The condition starts when bacteria colonize food particles in a pet’s mouth and form plaque on their teeth. The plaque solidifies and becomes calculus, or tartar. In addition, the bacteria can invade under your pet’s gumline, resulting in inflammation and damage to the structures supporting their teeth. The first stage of periodontal disease is gingivitis. At this stage, no bone loss has occurred, and the tooth is firmly attached to the supporting structures. 
Treatment: Jake needed a professional veterinary dental cleaning to remove the bacteria under his gum line. He was placed under general anesthesia so the procedure could be performed safely and effectively. X-rays were taken to fully evaluate his dental health status, and no bone loss was apparent. Jake’s prognosis is good since his condition was mild, but his owner was instructed to start brushing the dog’s teeth daily to keep his mouth healthy between yearly professional cleanings.",https://angelscampvetgroup.com/pet-dental-health-case-studies/,"
Thank you for sharing this information with me. The symptoms you described are concerning and could potentially indicate a dental problem in Jake. Bad breath (halitosis) can be caused by a variety of factors, including dental decay, gum disease, or a foreign body lodged in the mouth. The presence of blood on his chew toys is also concerning, as it could indicate that he has bitten down on something and injured his gums or teeth.

During Jake's annual wellness visit, I will perform a thorough dental examination to assess the health of his teeth and gums. This may include visual inspection, probing, and radiographs (x-rays) to identify any signs of dental disease. Depending on the severity of the problem, treatment options may range from a professional cleaning and scaling to more complex procedures such as extractions or dental restoration.

In addition to addressing any dental issues, I will also evaluate Jake's overall health to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that could be contributing to his bad breath or bleeding gums. This may include blood work and other diagnostic tests to identify any potential health problems.

It is important to address these symptoms promptly to prevent further complications and ensure that Jake stays healthy and comfortable. As always, I will provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for Jake's teeth and gums at home, and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.",,,,,
1,"Casey is a 14-year-old spayed domestic shorthair cat. Her owner brought her in because the right side of the cat’s face was swollen and she had stopped eating. On examination, Casey had a prominent, painful swelling on the right side of her face, and her right eye was tearing. An oral examination revealed that the tissue around Casey’s right upper canine tooth was inflamed and swollen.",-,"If bacteria aren’t removed from under a pet’s gumline, the pathogens can invade the tooth root, leading to infection. The second stage of periodontal disease involves mild bone loss, which is visible on X-rays, and loss of 25% or less of the tooth’s supporting structures. 
Treatment: Casey was placed under general anesthesia, and X-rays were taken, revealing a tooth root abscess and mild bone loss. The affected tooth was extracted, and the socket was irrigated using an antibiotic solution. While under general anesthesia, Casey received a complete dental cleaning. She was sent home on systemic antibiotics for one week, and her owner was instructed to bring Casey back in six months to evaluate her dental health status. Daily toothbrushing also was recommended.",https://angelscampvetgroup.com/pet-dental-health-case-studies/," Thank you for providing the details of Casey's case. Based on the symptoms you've described, there are several possible causes for the swelling on Casey's right side of her face and the inflammation around her right upper canine tooth. Here are some potential explanations:

1. Dental abscess: An abscess is a pocket of pus that forms in response to bacterial infection. It could be caused by a deep bacterial infection in Casey's gum tissue around her right upper canine tooth, which could have spread to the surrounding tissues and caused swelling.
2. Respiratory tract infection: A bacterial or fungal infection in Casey's respiratory tract could cause swelling on her right side of face, especially if it has spread to the sinuses.
3. Sinusitis: An infection in Casey's sinuses can cause swelling on her right side of the face, including around her eye and tooth.
4. Oral tumors: A benign or malignant tumor in Casey's mouth could be causing the swelling around her right upper canine tooth.
5. Trauma: If Casey has recently experienced any trauma to her face, it could cause swelling and pain on the affected side.

It is important to conduct further diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of Casey's symptoms. These may include imaging studies such as radiographs (x-rays) or CT scans, as well as a thorough examination of her mouth and sinuses. Based on the diagnosis, appropriate treatment can be initiated to manage Casey's symptoms and address any underlying conditions.

In the meantime, it is important to monitor Casey's condition closely and seek veterinary care if her symptoms worsen or if she shows signs of distress or discomfort.",,,,,
2,"Karl is a 5-year-old neutered greyhound. Karl’s owner was concerned because he wouldn’t allow his face to be touched, and he seemed to be “eating funny.” Karl was also excessively salivating. On examination, Karl was sensitive to touch on the right side of his face and was reluctant to allow a thorough oral examination. The dog was sedated to make it easier to examine his mouth, and a lower molar on the right side of his mouth was found to be loose.",,"As periodontal disease progresses to stage three, moderate bone loss can be seen on X-rays, and 25% to 50%of the tooth’s supporting structures are lost. Breeds such as greyhounds, who have sleek, narrow skulls, are especially at risk because they have less bone mass to support their teeth.
Treatment: Once Karl was under general anesthesia, X-rays were taken, which showed moderate bone loss and deterioration of the affected tooth root. The tooth was removed, and Karl received a thorough dental cleaning. Karl was sent home on a two-week course of systemic antibiotics, and scheduled for a recheck in three months to assess his progress. His owner also was instructed to begin daily toothbrushing.",https://angelscampvetgroup.com/pet-dental-health-case-studies/,"
Thank you for providing me with this case scenario. Based on the information provided, there are several possible reasons why Karl is exhibiting these behaviors. Here are some potential causes:

1. Dental issues: As you mentioned, a loose lower molar on the right side of Karl's mouth could be causing him discomfort or pain, which may explain his reluctance to allow a thorough oral examination. It's possible that he is ""eating funny"" due to this dental issue.
2. Facial trauma: The sensitivity to touch on the right side of Karl's face could indicate previous trauma to that area, which may be causing him discomfort or pain when touched. This trauma could have occurred at any point in his life and may not necessarily be related to the dental issue.
3. Skin allergies: If Karl is sensitive to touch on the right side of his face, it's possible that he has a skin allergy or irritation in that area. This could cause him to avoid being touched in that area and may also lead to excessive salivation.
4. Oral cancer: A loose lower molar is not typically associated with oral cancer, but it's possible that Karl has another type of oral tumor or mass that is causing his symptoms. An oral examination and potentially some diagnostic tests (such as a fine needle aspirate or imaging studies) may be necessary to rule out this possibility.
5. Other medical conditions: There are many other potential medical conditions that could be causing Karl's symptoms, such as an upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, or a neurological disorder. It's important to perform a thorough physical examination and any necessary diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Based on these possibilities, it would be appropriate to refer Karl to a veterinarian for further evaluation and diagnosis. The veterinarian will be able to perform a more thorough examination and run any necessary tests to determine the cause of Karl's symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",,,,,
3,"Dolly was a 14-year-old spayed female Chihuahua. Her owner brought her in for an examination because the dog was unable to eat and had a persistently open mouth. Her owner said the dog had had a decreased appetite for about a week, but the open mouth occurred the day of the veterinary visit. An examination revealed Dolly had an elevated temperature, and her lower jaw appeared fractured. Blood work showed an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection, and elevated kidney values. ",-,"When periodontal disease becomes advanced, severe bone loss can occur and more than 50% of the tooth’s supporting structures are lost. Toy breeds, such as Chihuahuas, are at risk for jaw fractures because the roots of their teeth are so close to the edges of their jawbones. In addition to the damage done by the fracture, bacteria can enter the pet’s bloodstream, causing damage to organs throughout their body, including the kidneys, liver, and heart. 
Treatment: Dolly was placed on intravenous fluids to help correct her increased kidney values, and X-rays were taken to assess the extent of her fractured jaw. Sadly, the X-rays revealed extensive bone loss, and her mandible was too damaged and fragile to repair surgically. Dolly’s owners elected to euthanize her to save her further pain.",https://angelscampvetgroup.com/pet-dental-health-case-studies/," Thank you for providing the case details of Dolly, a 14-year-old spayed female Chihuahua. Based on the symptoms you've mentioned, there are several possible causes that could be contributing to Dolly's condition.

Firstly, an elevated temperature and open mouth can be indicative of dental problems such as abscesses or periodontal disease. The fractured lower jaw could also be a result of trauma caused by biting down on something hard or getting hit by a car. The elevated white blood cell count and kidney values suggest that Dolly may have an infection, which could be related to the dental issues or another underlying condition such as kidney disease.

As a veterinarian, I would recommend conducting further diagnostic tests such as X-rays, blood cultures, and urinalysis to determine the root cause of Dolly's symptoms. Depending on the diagnosis, treatment options could include antibiotics for infection, dental surgery to address any dental problems, or management of any underlying kidney disease.

In some cases, hospitalization may be necessary to monitor and treat the dog's condition closely. It's important to identify and address the underlying cause of Dolly's symptoms promptly to prevent further complications and ensure a full recovery. Can you tell me more about Dolly's medical history, including any previous illnesses or injuries?",,,,,
4,"A 13-year-old, female Shiba dog presented with elevation ofthe right pelvic limb and swelling of the thigh. Subcuta-neous haemorrhaging was noted in the swollen area. However,the general condition was good, and no gastrointestinalsymptoms such as vomiting or diarrhoea were right stifle, but the white blood cell count was normal,with no decrease in the platelet count. Blood smear anal-ysis showed no abnormal cells to indicate a tumour in theblood. Bio-chemical tests revealed elevated alkaline phos-phatase,suggestingincreasedbonemetabolism Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed a large number ofmast cell infiltrates in the stifle, with each mast cell beinglargeinsizeandrichingranules. Computedtomography (CT) showed no evidence of MCT spread to theintra-abdominal or other organs. However, the cortex of thefemurandtibianearthestiflejoint,whichwasincontactwiththe swelling, was thinning, and in some places, the cortexhad fractured, and soft tissues had infiltrated into the bone",Image Case 5,"In this case, MCT involved subcutaneous bleeding, andswelling was observed in the right pelvic thigh. Hence, anti-histaminic treatment was started from the day of admission,including subcutaneous prednisolone (1 mg/kg, prednisoloneinjection  NZ;  Nippon  Zenyaku  Kogyo),  intramusculardiphenhydramine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg, diphenhydramine njection; Nissin Pharmaceutical) and intravenous famotidine(1 mg/kg, Gaster Injection; LTL Pharma).Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous injection of fen-tanyl (0.05 mg/kg, fentanyl injection; Daiichi Sankyo), mida-zolam (0.1 mg/kg, Dorumicum Injection; Maruishi Pharma-ceutical) and propofol (6 mg/kg, Propofol 1% injection; MSDAnimal Health).

Based on the symptoms and findings presented, I would diagnose this 13-year-old Shiba dog with a condition called osteosarcoma, which is a type of bone cancer that affects dogs. The elevation of the right pelvic limb and swelling of the thigh, along with subcutaneous hemorrhaging in the affected area, are all classic signs of this disease.

The normal white blood cell count and lack of abnormal cells on blood smear analysis suggest that the dog does not have a systemic tumor disorder, such as lymphoma or leukemia. The elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, however, indicate increased bone metabolism, which is consistent with osteosarcoma.

The findings of the fine-needle aspiration cytology are also consistent with osteosarcoma, as it revealed a large number of mast cells infiltrates in the stifle joint, which can indicate bone tumor formation. The absence of any evidence of metastasis to the intra-abdominal or other organs through CT scanning further supports this diagnosis.

The thinning and fractured cortex of the femur and tibia near the stifle joint, which are in contact with the swelling, also suggest that the dog has osteosarcoma. This is because bone tumors can cause degenerative changes in the affected bone, leading to thinning and fracturing of the cortex.

Based on these findings, I would recommend surgical removal of the affected limb to treat the osteosarcoma. This will help prevent further spread of the tumor and relieve the dog's pain and discomfort. Additionally, chemotherapy may be considered to reduce the risk of recurrence of the disease.

I hope this helps you in making an informed decision regarding your dog's treatment plan. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.","The image shows a large number of mast cell infiltrates in the stifle joint of the dog.

5,"A 19.5-kg, 1-year-old, male, entire lurcher presented with devition of the muzzle to the left and inability to open the mouth.The owners had noted a progressive reduction in the ability to open the mouth from around 6 months of age. The bodycondition score was good (4/9). A class IV malocclusion in aside-to-side manner with buccoversion of the right mandibular premolars resulted in an open bite enabling the dog to eatsmall kibble. The owners obtained the dog as an 8-week-oldpuppy, and there was no history of trauma and no similarabnormality in any litter mate. Conscious examination revealed deviation of the muzzle tothe left, mandibular distoclusion class II, class IV malocclu-sion in a side-to-side manner (maxillomandibular asymme-try) and mildly enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. Therewas no reaction to palpation of the maxillary or mandibularregions. No voluntary mandibular movement was noted onobservation and the mouth was unable to be opened.The dog was sedated with medetomidine (0.005 mg/kg;1 mg/mL, Sedator, Dechra) and butorphanol (0.3 mg/kg;10 mg/mL, Torbugesic, Zoetis) for further examination.

Overcrowding of the left maxillary molar teeth with buc-cal displacement of the rostral mandibular premolar teethbilaterally up to 12 mm from the mandibular midline",Image Case 6,"Following premedication with methadone (0.3 mg/kg intra-venous; 10 mg/mL, Synthadon, Animalcare) and medetomi-dine (0.005 mg/kg; 1 mg/mL, Sedator, Dechra), anaesthesiawas induced and maintained with a propofol constant-rateinfusion (CRI) at 0.1 mg/kg/h (10 mg/mL, Propofol, Ani-malCare) and medetomidine CRI at 1–2μg/kg/h (1 mg/mL,Sedator, Dechra). Paracetamol (10 mg/kg; 10 mg/mL, Parac-etamol, B.

Based on the presented case, here is my detailed analysis and explanation of the abnormalities observed in the dog's temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and maxilla:

1. Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ):
a. The left TMJ remains congruent, but there are slight flattening and undulation of the mandibular fossa and condyloid process of the left mandibular bone.
b. Proliferative new bone with a multi-layered appearance arises from the lateral cortex of the left mandibular ramus and bridges with the rostral aspect of the zygomatic bone and zygomatic process of the left maxilla.
c. There is a slight blunting of the left retro-articular process relative to the contralateral side.
2. Maxilla:
a. Malformation of the caudal right maxillary bone with severe sclerosis and thickening of the right maxillary zygomatic process.
b. Rostral location of the left TMJ relative to the right, leading to apparent foreshortening of the left mandible.
c. Left-sided deviation of both the right and left maxilla, nasal cavities, and nasal septum.
d. Overcrowding of the left maxillary molar teeth with buccal displacement of the rostral mandibular premolar teeth bilaterally up to 12 mm from the mandibular midline.

Based on these findings, here are my interpretations and recommendations:

a. The dog's deviated muzzle and inability to open its mouth are likely due to abnormalities in the TMJ and maxilla.
b. The flattening and undulation of the mandibular fossa and condyloid process, as well as the proliferative new bone in the left TMJ, suggest a developmental or growth plate disorder in this joint.
c. The malformation of the caudal right maxillary bone and severe sclerosis of the right maxillary zygomatic process may contribute to the left-sided deviation of the mandible and nasal cavities.
d. The overcrowding of the left maxillary molar teeth and buccal displacement of the rostral mandibular premolar teeth may indicate a dental malocclusion, which can also contribute to the dog's inability to open its mouth.

Based on these findings, I recommend further diagnostic imaging and consultation with an oral surgeon or orthopedic specialist to determine the best course of treatment for this dog.","The image shows a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head of an entire male lurcher, which is a type of dog.

Additionally, there is mildly enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. The CT scan also shows a reduction in the size of the mandible, particularly the medial aspect, and a corresponding dorsal displacement of the tongue, which is preventing the mouth from opening completely.",,,,
6,"A  12-  year-  old,  17-  kg,  female  neutered  Poodle  mix  dog  was  presented  for  coughing,  snoring,  exercise  intolerance  and  lethargy.  The  owner  had  noticed  that  the  dog  made  gasping  sounds  associated  with  eating. The symptoms were noticed 2 months prior to  the  presentation,  but  the  owner  did  not  seek  veterinary  advice  due  to  financial  constraints.  He  mentioned that he had administered antibiotics and steroids to the dog, following information found on the internet.On  presentation,  physical  examination  revealed  tachypnoea  (panting),  normal  heart  rate  and  body  temperature. During the examination, the dog was bright,  alert,  but  had  a  constant  inspiratory  and  expiratory  rattling  noise.  A  non-  painful  ventral  neck   mass,   approximately   3.32   cm×7.12   cm   in   dimension, was seen on the right ventral side of the cervical  region  compressing  the  trachea  (figure  1). The  overlying  skin  was  normal.  During  the  palpa-tion  of  the  trachea,  coughing  was  easily  elicited.  The  cough  was  harsh,  sonorous  and  terminated  in  retching. Oral examination revealed mild inflam-mation  of  the  gingival  attachments  and  plaque  covering  molars  and  premolars.  The  tonsils  and  the  lymph  nodes  of  the  area  (mandibular,  pres-capular) were of normal size and consistency. The dog’s BCS was 9 (17 kg). Based on the history and clinical examination findings, thoracic radiographs and  ultrasonographic  examination  of  the  mass  were proposed to confirm the origin of the mass along  with  concurrent  heart  or  lung  pathology.  In  addition,  general  blood  and  serum  tests  were  suggested as part of a pre- anaesthetic work- up to assess the patient’s overall health.
The  general  blood  profile  and  serum  analysis  were unremarkable. Serum concentrations of T4fT4 and TSH were within normal limits. The dog was serolog-ical  negative  for  Dirofilaria  immitis  and  Leishmania  infantum. Imaging tests were done without sedation. Thoracic radiography revealed a bronchial pattern, excessive bronchial wall thickening and peribronchial infiltration. There was evidence of right- sided cardiomegaly  and  pulmonary  hypertension,  as  a  consequence  of  chronic  airway  disease.  Cervical  radiographic  examination  was  not  performed  at  that  time.  Ultrasonographic  examina-tion  of  the  mass  was  performed  with  a  7.5-  MHz  curvilinear  transducer  since  no  higher  frequency  transducer  was  available.  Findings  presented  a  well-  defined  cystic  lesion  with  thin  walls  and hypoechoic lesions, without internal vascularity, filled with hypoechoic fluid (figure 2A,B).Aspiration of the cyst was performed and 5 mL of thick, sero-sanguinous  mucinous  fluid  was  aspirated.  Fine-  needle  aspira-tion of the right mandibular lymph node revealed inflammatory infiltration.Because  incisional  biopsy  and  computed  tomographic  exam-ination  were  proposed  but  declined  by  the  owner,  a  postoper-ative  histopathology  examination  of  the  mass  confirmed  the  diagnosis  of  thyroglossal  duct  cyst.

Induction  of  general  anaesthesia  was  achieved  using  propofol  (Propofol;  Fresenius  Kabi,  Hellas)  2  mg/kg  intravenously  and  after  endotracheal  intubation  was  maintained  with  isoflurane  (Isofluran; Abbott, USA) delivered in oxygen.The dog was positioned in dorsal recumbency. A midline inci-sion was performed using a scalpel blade no. 10 from the caudal submandibular region to the distal third of the cervical trachea. After the transection of sternohyoid muscles, the cyst was iden-tified  as  a  multilocular  thin-  walled  structure,  full  of  mucinous  fluid.  Blunt  and  sharp  dissection  of  the  loose  connective  tissue  was  used  in  order  to  free  the  mass  from  surrounding  tissues.  There was mild bleeding which was controlled with pressure and electrocautery. The closure of the surgical incision was done in three layers. The apposition of the muscles was done in a simple continuous  pattern  (Vicryl  2/0;  Ethicon,  USA).  The  connective  tissue  was  sutured  in  a  simple  continuous  pattern  (Vicryl  2/0;  Ethicon).The skin was closed in a simple interrupted pattern (Ethibond excel 3/0; Ethicon).Postoperatively,  the  dog  received  amoxicillin  with  clavulanic  acid (Synulox; Pfizer, Italy) 22 mg/kg every 12 hours for 10 days and  carprofen  (Rimadyl;  Pfizer,  USA)  2  mg/kg  every  12  hours  for 4 days. Although the surgery was done in an aseptic manner, we decided to prescribe antibiotic treatment until receiving the histopathology  results,  10  days  later,  as  the  abscess  was  still  in  our differential diagnosis. In addition to that, we considered the concurrent  chronic  bronchitis  with  possible  respiratory  infec-tion, the concurrent gingivitis, the dog’s old age, BCS of 9, the seroma  formation,  the  use  of  electrocautery,  and  the  wrongful  administration  of  antibiotics  and  steroids  from  the  owner  as  further  predisposing  factors  for  infection.

Oral  prednisolone  (Prezolon;  Takeda  Hellas  AE)  0.5  mg/kg  every  12  hours  initially  was  given  for  1 week and then tapered off over the next 3 weeks. Also, salbu-tamol (Asthmotrat; Intermed A.B.E.E., Hellas) 0.05 mg/kg every 12 hours and doxycycline (Vibramycin; Pfizer Hellas) 10 mg/kg once a day were administered for 6 weeks",https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1136/vetreccr-2019-000996,"
The case presented is of a 12-year-old, 17 kg female Poodle mix dog that was brought in for coughing, snoring, exercise intolerance, and lethargy. The owner had noticed gasping sounds associated with eating two months prior to presentation, but did not seek veterinary advice due to financial constraints. On presentation, the dog had tachypnea, normal heart rate, and body temperature. A non-painful ventral neck mass was seen on the right ventral side of the cervical region, compressing the trachea. The owner had previously administered antibiotics and steroids to the dog based on information found on the internet.

Based on the history and clinical examination findings, thoracic radiographs and ultrasonographic examination of the mass were proposed to confirm the origin of the mass along with concurrent heart or lung pathology. General blood and serum tests were suggested as part of a pre-anaesthetic workup to assess the patient's overall health. The general blood profile and serum analysis were unremarkable, with normal levels of T4, T3, and TSH. Serum concentrations of Dirofilaria immitis and Leishmania infantum were also negative. Imaging tests were done without sedation, revealing a bronchial pattern, excessive bronchial wall thickening, and peribronchial infiltration on thoracic radiographs, as well as right-sided cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension due to chronic airway disease. Cervical radiographic examination was not performed at that time. Ultrasonographic examination of the mass revealed a well-defined cystic lesion with thin walls and hypoechoic lesions, without internal vascularity, filled with hypoechoic fluid. Aspiration of the cyst was performed, and 5 mL of thick, serous-sanguinous mucinous fluid was aspirated. Fine-needle aspiration of the right mandibular lymph node revealed inflammatory infiltration.

Based on the postoperative histopathology examination of the mass, the diagnosis of thyroglossal duct cyst was confirmed. The description mentioned an outer connective tissue wall infiltrated with inflammatory cells, along with an inner cystic wall consisted of islands made from thyroid follicles, surrounded by cuboidal cells.

In conclusion, the case presented is of a 12-year-old female Poodle mix dog with a thyroglossal duct cyst, which is a rare congenital malformation of the neck. The dog had been experiencing symptoms for two months prior to presentation, but the owner did not seek veterinary advice due to financial constraints. The diagnosis was confirmed through ultrasonographic examination and postoperative histopathology. The case highlights the importance of early detection and treatment of this rare condition to prevent complications and improve the dog's quality of life.","The image shows a female neutered Poodle mix dog that was presented for coughing, snoring, exercise intolerance, and lethargy.

7,"Case A was a 6-month-old, female, spayed Shih tzu/Yorkshire terrier mixed breed dog. The owners noted a swelling under the dog’s tongue at 3 months of age. At that time, the referring veterinarian reported a blue, fluctuant, non-painful, soft tissue swelling under the right rostral aspect of the tongue, which extended from the region of the right mandibular canine tooth to the distal aspect of the right mandibular first premolar This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

At 6 months of age, the referring veterinarian performed an oral examination under general anesthesia and skull radiographs, coinciding with ovariohysterectomy and umbilical hernia repair. Fine-needle aspiration of the swelling was performed, which revealed a black to brown fluid similar to what has been described in the literature.2 Unfortunately, the cytologic sample was not of diagnostic value. The patient was referred to the Dentistry and Oral Surgery Service at Iowa State University Lloyd Veterinary Medical Center for further evaluation. On conscious oral examination, the patient was found to have a class 4 malocclusion. There was a 4 × 2 × 2 cm, round, non-painful, non-mobile soft tissue swelling under the right side of the tongue at the rostral aspect of the right mandible. There was no clinical evidence of a right mandibular canine tooth. The patient also appeared to be missing several mandibular incisor teeth.",Image Case 8,"The patient was premedicated and induced for general anaesthesia (dexmedetomidine 0.0025 mg/kg intravenously [IV], hydromorphone 0.1 mg/kg IV, propofol 5 mg/kg IV), intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube and maintained on 1.5%–2.5% isoflurane anaesthesia to maintain appropriate anaesthetic depth. An anaesthetised oral examination including full-mouth intraoral radiographs revealed an unerupted right mandibular second incisor tooth and right mandibular canine tooth (402, 404), as well as a persistent deciduous right mandibular second incisor tooth and right mandibular canine tooth (802, 804). There was a radiolucent bony expansion in the right rostral mandible, with minimal alveolar bone supporting the erupted right mandibular first and third permanent incisors (401, 403) and deciduous second incisor (802), and the unerupted right mandibular second incisor and right mandibular canine tooth (402, 404) (Figure 1a). The right mandibular second premolar (406) and the left and right mandibular third molars (311, 411) were clinically and radiographically absent. There were round radiolucent opacities in the pulp cavity of the right mandibular first molar tooth (409), which appeared consistent with the radiographic appearance of pulp stones. The patient was placed in sternal recumbency for computed tomography of the head through the third cervical vertebrae. The patient was then given iohexol (400 mgI/kg IV; Omnpaque 240 positive contrast, Nycomed) for a positive contrast computed tomography scan. The scan revealed an expansive soft tissue attenuating, non-contrast enhancing structure with thin smooth cortical margins in the region of the right rostral mandible. There was minimal alveolar bone on the lingual aspect of the right mandibular first incisor to the canine tooth (401 to 404) (Figure 1b). The patient had six teeth extracted, which included the right mandibular first, second and third incisors, right mandibular canine tooth and the persistent deciduous right mandibular second incisor and canine tooth (401, 402, 403, 404, 802, 804). These teeth were extracted due to the intimate association with the suspected dentigerous cyst formation and concern for loss of alveolar bone support, as well as significant clinical mobility of the teeth. Bilateral caudal inferior alveolar nerve blocks were placed with 0.5 mg of bupivacaine per quadrant to provide regional anaesthesia to the surgical sites. A mucoperiosteal flap was created to facilitate tooth extraction. The mucosa was reflected with a periosteal elevator. Lagrange scissors, a periosteal elevator and a Miller’s surgical curette were used to remove the capsule lining encompassing the cyst. The cavity was flushed with 0.9% sterile saline. The surgical flaps were closed with a 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture material in a simple interrupted suture pattern. Post-operative radiographs were performed showing complete extraction of the teeth and no obvious evidence of retained tooth roots, as well as no evidence of an iatrogenic mandibular fracture (Figure 1c). The teeth, capsule lining and samples of the alveolar bone were submitted for a histopathologic diagnosis. Histopathologically, the diagnosis was determined to be an odontogenic cyst, with further classification as a dentigerous cyst associated with the impacted right mandibular canine tooth (404). Radiographically, this tooth showed evidence of arrested tooth development compared to the surrounding teeth. The patient underwent a computed tomography scan of the skull 7 months following treatment, which showed osseus remodelling of the right rostral mandible and no evidence of cyst recurrence",https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/vrc2.652," Based on the information provided, here is what I can gather about Case A's oral examination findings:

1. Age: Case A was 6 months old at the time of the oral examination.
2. Breed: The patient was a Shih tzu/Yorkshire terrier mixed breed dog.
3. Sex: Case A was a female dog.
4. Spaying status: Case A was spayed.
5. Swelling location: A blue, fluctuant, non-painful, soft tissue swelling was observed under the right rostral aspect of the tongue, extending from the region of the right mandibular canine tooth to the distal aspect of the right mandibular first premolar.
6. Size: The swelling was approximately 4 cm in diameter.
7. Mobility: The swelling was non-mobile.
8. Cytological sample: A fine-needle aspiration of the swelling was performed, but the cytologic sample was not of diagnostic value.
9. Malocclusion: Case A had a class 4 malocclusion, which means that there was an significant crowding or misalignment of the teeth.
10. Missing teeth: There was no clinical evidence of a right mandibular canine tooth, and the patient appeared to be missing several mandibular incisor teeth.

Based on these findings, it is possible that Case A may have had an oral mass or tumor, which could have caused the swelling under her tongue. The lack of diagnostic value of the cytological sample and the absence of a right mandibular canine tooth suggest that the swelling may not be related to a dental abscess or infection. However, without further diagnostic tests such as imaging studies (e.g., X-rays or CT scans) or a biopsy, it is difficult to definitively diagnose the cause of the swelling.","The case involves a 6-month-old, female, spayed Shih tzu/Yorkshire terrier mixed breed dog. The owners noted a swelling under the dog's tongue at 3 months of age. The case was initially diagnosed as mild hyperplasia of the lingual gland. However, the lesion showed a rapid growth rate, and the owners decided to have surgery performed to remove the mass.",,,,
