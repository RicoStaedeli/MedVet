1,"A 3 month German Short Hair is presented with decreased appetite. The owner reported he let his dog play with a deer antler when he suddenly heard the dog scream. He saw a few drops of blood but the bleeding stopped quickly.
This was 3 days ago. The dog also seemed more tired which is atypical for his character. Upon examination the 508 seemed damaged and traces of blood seemed to come out of the tooth's crown",,"The dog is very likely to suffer from a CCF of the upper 4th deciduous premolar tooth. It was probably caused by chewing on a hard subject like the deer antler. Infection and inflammation accompanied by pain are the result.
Treatment: As it is a deciducous tooth, the only viable treatment is extraction of the affected tooth. Care has to be taken to not cause harm to the underlying permanent teeth.",,,,,,
2,"An 11 month british short hair is presented with what seems inability to eat. The owner reports that the cat wants to eat but then chenges its mind and walks away from the food. It has been losing weight for about 2 weeks.
Upon examination the cat shows mild gingivitis as well as bilateral deep inflamed lesions in the region of the mesial roots of the 309 and 409.",,"Especially brachicephalic cat breeds suffer from a type of malocclusion where the upper 4th premolars cause trauma to the soft tissues of the lower jaw. usually in the region of lower 4th premolars and 1st molars.
Treatment: odontoplasty and sealing of the upper 4th premolars. possible extraction of lower teeth if damage seems irreversible.",,,,,,
3,A 12 year Chihuahua presents with inability to close mouth and to eat after falling from the couch a day prior. Examination was difficult due to severe pain in the lower jaw region and the patient being aggressive. Extreme halitosis and lose teeth were noted. the dog was anesthetised to take dental radiographs and a CBCT scan. Fracture of the left manbile between 308 and 309 was noted.,,"Small breed dogs tend to develop severe periodontitis. this can cause a degree of bone loss so that the structural integrity of the mandible can be compromised. Mild trauma can cause the bone to fracture.
Treatment: If enough teeth with reasonable stability are still present in the affected mandible. then an intraoral splint can be a good form of treatment. If this is not the case, fracture repair using mini plates can be performed. Alternatively cerclage wire or amputation are options. Many of these treatments can be combined with a tape muzzle",,,,,,
4,"A 5 year old mixed breed dog coming from a shelter presents with inability to open or close his mouth. He is able to lick foow through a 1cm gap between upper and lower jaw. The owner reported that the shelter said this had always been the case. The dog was living on the streets before it was brought into the shelter. Upon examination it was not possible to open or close the dogs mouth. It did not seem to be painful.
Moderate to severe periodontitis was visible. The dog was put under anesthesia and a CBCT Scan was performed. A fusion of the proc coronoideus of the left mandible with the zygomatic arch was visible",,"Ankylosis and pseudoankylosis of the TMJ are usually the result of severe trauma affecting young animals. A side effect of the healing process is fusion of the TMJ itself or of the neighbouring structures hindering the jaws ability to move.
Treatment: Gap arthroplasty is performed using piezo surgery to remove the fused bones and to create a gap to give the remaining parts the ability to move freely. Fatty tissue or muscle should be put into the gap to prevent the bone from fusing together again. Prednisone for a prolonged period of time can be helpful.",,,,,,
5,A 7 year old male neutered Golden Retriever presents with inability to jawn or bark. Eating seems unaffected. The owner reported the dog screaming when trying of open mouth wide. Upon examination the right eye seemed more prominent. The dog showed extreme pain when trying to open the mouth manually. Contrast CT was carried out and showed a contrast enriched tissue in the area of the right zygomatic gland.,,"A typical reason for inability to open mouth wide is a retrobulbar process. This can be an abscess due to a foreign body (stick injury) or a tumor. Swelling of this region leads to esophtalmus and pain when the coronoid process is moved forward when opening the mouth wide.
Treatment: A cut behind the last molar of the affected side of the upper jaw should be made to release pressure and take a biopsy. NSAIDs and Antibiotics should be administered for about a week. further treatment might be necessary depending on histopathology results.",,,,,,
