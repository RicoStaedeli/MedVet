142: page_content='due to the array of possible clinical presentations and anatomic\ncomplexity of the region. The retrobulbar space is the area within\nthe orbit that lies caudal to the globe. Six bones contribute to'
143: page_content='the structure of the orbit: frontal, lacrimal, maxillary, zygomatic,\npalatine, and sphenoid (1, 2). The orbit of dogs is not a\ncomplete bony structure. The lateral wall is bound by both\nthe lateral orbital ligament and medial surface of the temporal'
144: page_content='muscle, while the ventral ﬂoor is formed by soft tissues that\ninclude the medial pterygoid muscle, zygomatic salivary gland,\nand orbital adipose tissue (1, 3). The retrobulbar tissues of\nthe dog include extraocular muscles, the lacrimal gland, the'
145: page_content='zygomatic salivary gland, masticatory muscles, nerves, blood\nvessels, and the bones that form the orbit (Figure 1). The\norbit contains a cone of eye-associated structures termed the\nperiorbita, the apex of which points caudally. The periorbita'
146: page_content='is derived from the periosteum, encloses the caudal portion\nof the eyeball and the extrinsic muscles of the eye, and is\nsurrounded by orbital fat. The extrinsic muscles of the eye\nthat are contained within and visible through the periorbita'
147: page_content='are the dorsal, ventral, lateral and medial rectus muscles, the\nretractor bulbi with its four fascicles, and more superﬁcially\nand medially, the dorsal oblique muscle. All of the extrinsic'
148: page_content='muscles of the eye except for the ventral oblique originate in\nthe apex of the orbit (1, 4–6). The orbit serves to position\nand protect the globe and house the retrobulbar tissues\n(2).\nThe orbit, and thus the retrobulbar contents it contains,'
149: page_content='is intimately related to many other structures of the head. It\nabuts the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, which are located\nmedial and dorsal to the orbit; it is closely associated with the'
150: page_content='cranial cavity, which is located caudomedial to the orbit; and it\nis adjacent to the mouth, which is located ventral to the orbit\n(7). The apices of the maxillary fourth premolar tooth and ﬁrst'
151: page_content='and second molar teeth are in close proximity to the orbital\nﬂoor, separated from ventral orbital soft tissues by a thin layer\nof alveolar bone (8). The ramus and condylar process of the\nmandible lie caudal and lateral to the retrobulbar space (1).'

949: page_content='with piezoelectric instruments takes longer than with rotary burs\nor oscillating saws, especially when the surgeon is learning this\ntechnology (6, 10, 15, 17, 18). Spinelli et al. showed in a recent'
950: page_content='maxillofacial study in humans that the whole surgical procedure\ntook 35% longer with a piezoelectric bone unit compared with\nan oscillating saw (10). However, there are important variations\nfrom one study to another depending on the type of surgery,'
951: page_content='the type of instrument, and the experience of the surgeon. In\na randomized clinical evaluation of piezoelectric surgery versus\nrotary burs for lower third molar extractions, Barone et al. showed'
952: page_content='that piezoelectric bone surgery was faster (19). In a recent in vivo\nstudy on ventral slot surgery in dogs, mean surgical duration for\npiezoelectric intruments was significantly shorter than for surgical'
953: page_content='burs (23.4 versus 34.1 min) (20). Cutting efficiency of piezoelectric\ninstrument has also been compared with that of laser Er:YAG in\nan experimental study on sheep tibia; time necessary for cutting'
954: page_content='a 18 mm × 22 mm bone segment at mid-shaft was 160–200 s with\nthe piezoelectric instrument and longer with the laser (21).\nSafety\nReduced Neurological Trauma\nIt has been shown that a piezoelectric surgical instrument directly'
955: page_content='applied for 5 s on a peripheral nerve with a relatively high work-\ning force (1.5 N) did not dissect the nerve but induced some\nstructural and functional damage (22). The perineurium of the'
956: page_content='nerve remained intact even after nerve contact at peak force (3 N),\nthus enhancing the potential for functional recovery. Importantly,\nthe extent of damage was significantly higher with application of'
957: page_content='increased force on the nerve by the device, but not by activation of\nthe ultrasonic vibration (22). The efficacy and safety of piezoelec-\ntric bone surgery has been assessed in neurosurgery where it has'
958: page_content='been shown that osteotomy of parietal bone of the cranial vault\ncould be achieved without trauma to the dura matter (16).\nReduced Bleeding\nLess bleeding is observed during maxillofacial surgery with piezo-'
959: page_content='electric instruments compared to surgical burs or oscillating saws;\nblood loss is reduced by 25–30% (10, 17). There are different\nfactors responsible for the reduction in blood loss. Due to a better'
960: page_content='visibility and to the sparing-effect on soft tissues, blood vessel\ndamage is reduced. Furthermore, cavitation effect associated with\nultrasonic instrumentation has been shown to be responsible'
961: page_content='for the relative absence of blood at the surgical site (17, 23).\nMicrobubbles of gas dissolved in the fluid expand and contract\nwhen exposed to sinusoidal ultrasound waves. When they reach a'

963: page_content='piezoelectric instruments compared to an oscillating saw (10). In a\nstudy comparing human patients that had undergone mandibular\nthird molar extractions with a piezoelectric instrument to those'
964: page_content='that had the same procedure performed using a surgical drill,\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org\nMay 2015 | Volume 2 | Article 8\n2\nHennet\nPiezoelectric bone surgery in veterinary oromaxillofacial surgery'
965: page_content='it was found that the piezoelectric group had less postoperative\ninflammation, trismus, and pain, as well as a reduced necessity for\npostoperative medications (19). An experimental study on bovine'
966: page_content='cortical bone has compared intraosseous temperatures induced by\ndifferent piezoelectric instruments under controlled conditions.\nWhen the instruments were used at maximum power, irrigation'
967: page_content='at 50 ml/s and cutting pressure of 3 N, mean intraosseous tem-\nperature increases between 1.2 and 3.1°C were observed, with\nPiezotome2® (Satelec, Mérignac, France) producing the less heat'
968: page_content='(5). The temperature reached within bone was well below critical\nlevels for intraosseous hyperthermia (40–41°C) and bone necrosis\n(47°C) (24). The degree of the thermal bone damage is directly'
969: page_content='proportional to the resulting temperature at the cutting site and\nthe period of time the bone is exposed to that temperature. Under\nclinical conditions, a smaller amount of irrigant may be used'
970: page_content='or may not reach the tip of the instrument in deep cuts and\nmay result in higher intraosseous temperatures. Brief temperature\nrises above 47°C might not be detrimental if shorter than a few'
971: page_content='seconds (24). To lessen the risk of thermal damages, continu-\nous motion and pressure on bone should be avoided especially\nin deep cuts (11, 25). Intermittent motion applied to the bone'
972: page_content='with light pressure and copious irrigation helps preventing heat\nbuild-up (24).\nUser Friendly and Precision\nSeveral tip attachments are available, these differ in shapes, length,\nand design so as to adapt to specific anatomic regions or types'
973: page_content='of surgery. The tips are grouped by basic shape: sharp (scalpels\nand scrapers), serrated (saw), or diamond-coated (Figures 1A,B).\nBecause of the various tips, their small size as well as the cutting'
974: page_content='technology, the instrument can create a precise and thin cutting\nline in any direction even in areas with a difficult access.\nWhen using a surgical bur or saw, the cutting efficiency is'
975: page_content='linked to the pressure on bone. With a piezoelectric unit, cutting\nis due to the high frequency vibration of the tip of the instrument;\nexcessive pressure prevents vibration, decreases efficiency, and'
976: page_content='generates frictional heat. The handle of the instruments is held\nwith a modified pen grasp. A moderate force (1.5 –3 N) is used\nto allow the tip to vibrate (5, 22, 26–28). As a point of comparison,'
977: page_content='the axial force of handwriting has been reported to be close to\n1 N (29, 30). A Working pressure of 1.5 and 2.0 N with a min-\nimum of 30 ml/min cooling irrigation has been shown to fulfill'
978: page_content='the requirements for harmless intraosseous temperature. Beyond\n3 N, cutting efficiency was not improved but thermal damage was\nincreased (27). When the tip contacts cortical bone, then it quickly'
979: page_content='produces an increase in depth from loads of 50 to 100 g, but there\nis a decrease at 200 g, which mirrors the decrease in displacement\namplitude (28). A load of 150 g (approximately 1.5 N) has been'
980: page_content='therefore recommended for cutting cortical bone (26, 28). It is\nobvious from previous studies that the optimum force required\nto cut bone depends on the type of bone (cortical or spongious),'
981: page_content='its density (degree of mineralization), and the type of ultrasonic\ntip used (5, 25–28, 31). The surgeon must therefore get used to the\ncutting action of these new instruments and develop a tactile sense'
982: page_content='of how much pressure needs to be used in the different clinical\nsituations.\nBecause this technology is recent and there have been very\nfew studies on the cutting effect of the different tips on various'
983: page_content='bone types, clinical use is based more on personal experience\nand manufacturer’s recommendations than on scientific evalua-\ntions of the cutting performance of these instruments (26). When'
984: page_content='performing an osteotomy on dense cortical bone, the more pow-\nerful sharp serrated (saw-like) tips can be used. The tip is held\nperpendicular to the bone surface, and with copious irrigation'
985: page_content='(50 ml/s), the surface of the bone is penetrated with the tip in\na press cut action to form a punctuated line. Then, the tip is\nmoved back and forth along this punctuated line to create a'
986: page_content='groove. In more difficult areas, the bone can be cut to full depth\nusing a press cut action. In deep cuts, care must be taken that\nthe irrigation fluid reaches the tip and intermittent motions are'
987: page_content='used. The tip should not be angled laterally during the cutting\nto avoid breakage, it must be kept at right angle to the surface.\nThe handpiece is equipped with a sterile irrigation system. This'
988: page_content='helps to clear the surgical field, clean bone chips, dissipate heat due\nto friction, and improve hemostasis through the cavitation effect.\nThe handpiece is equipped with high luminosity LEDs (100,000'

1224: page_content='To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review of \nthe literature analytically evaluating the outcome of studies on \ntherapeutics for FCGS. It is prudent to critically and systemati-'
1225: page_content='cally evaluate this literature, especially when studies have thus \nfar failed to identify a consistent clinical resolution for this \ncondition.\nLack of Statistical Power\nOf the 16 articles included in this review, 6 were small retrospective'
1226: page_content='case series or single patient case reports (EDG IV or V). Lacking \nany statistical power, these articles provide weak evidence. That \nbeing said, it is heartening that, in general, more recent studies'
1227: page_content='have a higher EDG and EG than earlier studies. Ideally, studies \nwould build off of the results of one another, expanding promis-\ning level V experiments to a level II or I clinical trial. However,'
1228: page_content='in compiling FCGS articles, this is rarely the case. Instead, the \nliterature is at times circuitous, expending efforts in studies that \nstand to change the overall conversation minimally. For example,'

1231: page_content='collective knowledge about FCGS treatment. Similarly, a level V \nC single patient case report (46) published on recombinant feline \ninterferon omega was followed 7\xa0years later by a level IV C case'
1232: page_content='report (42) published testing the same drug in two cats with an \nalmost identical follow-up time and result.\nInconsistent Outcome Measurements\nThis review identified that 9 of the 16 articles assessed outcome'
1233: page_content='of FCGS treatment via semi-quantitative scoring systems. \nA\xa0novel\xa0custom scoring system was developed and defined in \nfour of these articles (28, 36, 39, 40), while two articles utilized'
1234: page_content='the same scoring system (10, 12), and three articles each modeled \ntheir scoring system off of different previously utilized scoring \nsystems (11, 37, 41). This represents a significant obstacle both to'
1235: page_content='the comparison of existing results and for the planning of future \nstudies. Recorded outcome measures in articles included in this \nstudy include gross examination of oral lesions by veterinarians,'
1236: page_content='other physical exam findings (such as body weight or body \ncondition score or prominence of mandibular lymph nodes), \nowner-reported clinical signs in the home setting, and/or owner-'
1237: page_content='perceived quality of life for their cat. This review not only found \nlittle consistency between articles in the scoring system used to \nrecord outcome but also in the duration of follow-up. Follow-up'
1238: page_content='periods ranged from 2 (43) to 354\xa0weeks (41). The lack of consist-\nency between studies in data reporting makes direct comparison \nof results problematic. In order to draw sound comparisons,'
1239: page_content='ideally all studies would adopt the same validated outcome \nmeasure, with histology of oral lesions being the gold standard. \nUniversal adoption of a standardized semi-quantitative scoring'
1240: page_content='system validated with histopathology results would be ideal. A \nlonger follow-up time is obviously superior to a shorter follow-up \nperiod, but at some point practicality limitations outweigh the'
1241: page_content='desire to continue collecting data. No study has explored the time \ncutoff after which response to either medical or surgical therapy \nremains static; until such a study is performed, it is reasonable'
1242: page_content='that prospective studies continue collecting data at least 6\xa0months \nbeyond plateaued response to treatment.\nRefractory versus Naïve FCGS\nIn analyzing articles whose focus is medical management, it is'
1243: page_content='important to bear in mind if the subjects are refractory to histori-\ncally performed dental extractions, if they have failed to respond \nto previous medical management attempts, or if their FCGS is'
1244: page_content='naïve to any previous therapeutic intervention. For example, it is \nnoteworthy that the clinical remission rate was strikingly similar \nfor cats involved in the two cyclosporine studies (12, 40) despite'
1245: page_content='the fact that one group of cats had been resistant to previous \nmedical management (40), whereas the other group had been \nrefractory to full-mouth extractions (12).\nExperimental Design Grade and \nEvidence\xa0Grade'
1246: page_content='The grading systems utilized in this study provide a framework for \nanalyzing experiment design and strength of the data reported. \nThe grading process is not intended to criticize specific articles,'
1247: page_content='and it is important to bear in mind that each article has its own \nstrengths and weaknesses. The key components that comprise a \nstrong FCGS study include the following: a large enough study'
1248: page_content='population to be representative, a prospective experimental \ndesign, a quantitative or at least semi-quantitative scoring system \nfor disease severity, and a long enough duration of follow-up to'
1249: page_content='convince the reader that results will be sustained indefinitely. \nNone of the articles included in this review meets all four of the \nabove criteria.\nThere were four articles awarded a level I EDG, in part because'
1250: page_content='they included either a control group (28, 36, 37) or a placebo group \n(12). While it is generally accepted that studies are strengthened by \nthe inclusion of a control or placebo group, this practice is poten-'
1251: page_content='tially problematic when applied to FCGS treatment clinical trials. \nOne such problem is deciding upon the treatment administered \nto the control group. Each of the controlled studies included in'
1252: page_content='this systematic review tests a different control treatment, namely \na corticosteroid (28), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (37), or \na diet (36). While selection of these control group treatments was'
1253: page_content='intended to provide internal validation via direct comparison \nwithin studies, it renders comparison across studies difficult, if \nnot meaningless. Control therapies have not been standardized;'
1254: page_content='it could be informative to define a standardized control therapy \nagainst which to compare novel therapies. A second problem is \nthe ethical dilemma that arises when cats enrolled in control or'
1255: page_content='placebo groups experience prolonged suffering by not receiving \nsuperior, or any, treatment. One approach could, thus, be to \neliminate placebo and control groups altogether. A benefit of this'
1256: page_content='action is that more cats would be available to receive and test \na treatment. Furthermore, spontaneous recovery or significant \nclinical improvement has never been reported in cats with refrac-'
1257: page_content='tory FCGS, which may devalue control or placebo groups (10). \nHowever, best practice in study design strives for the inclusion of \ncontrol and placebo groups. The ethical predicament that accom-'
1258: page_content='panies use of control and placebo groups could be mitigated by \nallowing for analgesic administration to all cats throughout the \nstudy period. Additionally, if the treatment being tested is found'
1259: page_content='to be promising, the cats in the control or placebo groups could \nbe converted to cats receiving treatment, as occurred in the single \nplacebo-controlled study discussed in this systematic review (i.e.,'
1260: page_content='a randomized controlled crossover study with one of the two \ntreatments being a placebo) (12).\nThere were two articles awarded a level A EG for including \nhistology of lesions post-treatment (10, 37). While FCGS is fre-'
1261: page_content='quently diagnosed on the basis of clinical appearance and clinical \nsigns, it is still beneficial to perform histopathology, ideally before \nand after treatment. Histopathology is useful not only to confirm'
1262: page_content='the diagnosis (i.e., differentiate it from other diseases, such as \nsquamous cell carcinoma) but also to help further classify and \nunderstand the lesion. The current lack of knowledge regarding'
1263: page_content='the etiology of FCGS and the extent of mucosal response to \ntherapy can only definitively be assessed via histological and \nimmunohistochemical means, which validate and compliment \nthe subjective assessment of clinical appearance and clinical'
1264: page_content='signs. The more histopathological knowledge we have of this \ndisease, the more potential there is to discovering the underlying \netiology(s) and the most efficacious treatments.\n8\nWiner et al.\nLiterature Review of Gingivostomatitis Treatment'

1266: page_content='teria were pre-defined to minimize bias; however, these criteria \nresulted in the exclusion of potentially influential articles. For \nexample, an article exploring the efficacy of bovine lactoferrin'
1267: page_content='was excluded because the study lacked a standardized defini-\ntion of FCGS, with one experimental cat’s disease described \nas “severe gingivitis with hemorrhage” (48). Another article \nreporting the outcome of various therapies, including corticos-'
1268: page_content='teroids, antibiotics, megestrol acetate, levamisole, azathioprine, \ncyclophosphamide, and injectable gold (aurothioglucose) was \nexcluded due to lack of defined treatment protocol, with incon-'
1269: page_content='sistent drug doses and no reporting of which cats received which \ntreatment(s) (16). Another article examining various medical \ntherapies, including diet adjustment, megestrol acetate, antibiot-'
1270: page_content='ics, corticosteroids, levamisole, and mouthwash, was excluded \nbecause of inconsistent treatment protocols as well as no defined \nfollow-up timeframe (8).\nA second potential limitation is that only treatments for'
1271: page_content='which there have been peer-reviewed studies published in the \nEnglish language could be included in this study. Although \nchlorambucil, vincristine, 5-fluorouracil, sulodexide, tacrolimus'
1272: page_content='topical, colchicine, and lysine have all been suggested as pos-\nsible therapies (23), to the authors’ knowledge, there are no \npublished reports assessing their efficacy within the veterinary \npeer-reviewed literature.'
1273: page_content='Because of the heterogeneity in outcome measurements, study \ndesign, population sizes, and follow-up times, it was impossible to \nperform a meta-analysis of articles’ data, and, thus, results of each \nstudy have been reported individually.'
1274: page_content='Future Directions\nIn considering treatment options for FCGS, veterinarians should \nstrive to adopt an evidence-based approach to their therapeutic \nrecommendations. While studies have shown the percentage of'
1275: page_content='cats that respond to various medical and surgical interventions, \nclinicians must sift through these data and apply it to their \nindividual patients. Many questions still remain\xa0–\xa0for which cats'
1276: page_content='should medical management be attempted initially versus recom-\nmending surgical management at the time of initial diagnosis? \nAt what point should medical management be discontinued in'
1277: page_content='favor of switching to surgical management if a cat is failing to \nrespond to therapy, versus administering an alternate medical \nmanagement? Can we predict which cats will respond to various \ntreatment types?'
1278: page_content='Veterinarians should strive to improve the quality of FCGS \nresearch and, thus, the evidence base available to inform col-\nleagues’ therapeutic recommendations in order to optimize patient'
1279: page_content='care. In addition, we should bear in mind both the strengths and \nweaknesses of the current literature when drawing conclusions. \nLarge prospective studies are needed to compare existing treat-'
1280: page_content='ments and demonstrate the promise of new treatments. With the \nemergence of novel and innovative therapeutics, the field of FCGS \nresearch would benefit from standardizing studies by adopting'
1281: page_content='use of the same quantitative or semi-quantitative scoring system \nand extending follow-up duration to at least 6\xa0months beyond \nplateaued response to treatment.\nCONCLUSION\nThe current peer-reviewed literature on FCGS therapeutic'
1282: page_content='outcome has demonstrated the statistical success rates of various \ntreatments, reporting the percentage of cats achieving clinical \nremission when treated with either medical or surgical manage-'
1283: page_content='ment. Future studies recapitulating this same point of view may \nfurther refine the success rates of therapies already in use, but \nthis may represent stagnation and not innovation. A subset of'
1284: page_content='cats suffering from FCGS remains refractory to the treatments \nevaluated in this systematic review, and to the authors’ knowledge \nthere is no therapy that has adequately and convincingly been'
1285: page_content='proven to achieve a 100% clinical remission rate. This most likely \nharkens back to the nebulous underlying etiology of FCGS and \nour current lack of understanding of its pathogenesis (12, 14). The'
1286: page_content='authors of this systematic review agree that full-mouth or near \nfull-mouth dental extractions is the current standard of care for \nFCGS (10, 41), but can we do better than the recently reported'
1287: page_content='complete remission rate of 28.4% (41) that surgical management \nattains? The “holy grail” of FCGS research is to discover the etiol-\nogy of FCGS and to identify a treatment protocol that attains a'
1288: page_content='near 100% remission rate. In order to progress toward this goal, \na paradigm shift in FCGS research is necessary. New directions \nmust be pursued, in which researchers focus on new and inno-'
1289: page_content='vative treatment strategies, such as modulating cats’ immune \nresponses underlying their oral inflammation. As this type of \nresearch is already underway (10), future additional studies are'
1290: page_content='required in order to ultimately discover both the cause and the \ncure for FCGS.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJW performed literature searches, determined which articles met \ninclusion criteria, proposed use of Experimental Design Grade'

1429: page_content='aspects of regeneration. It is not well understood how each\nmolecule acts alone and how a pool of available molecules\nmay better mimic natural microenvironmental conditions.17\nIt is likely that the delivery of multiple signals will result in'
1430: page_content='greater regeneration than that from a single molecule in\nisolation.22\nThe delivery method for these molecules is critical to the\nsuccess of the regenerative process. Applying these mole-\ncules into a scaffold for delivery has multiple advantages,'
1431: page_content='including more control of the release of the signals as\nopposed to simply injecting them into the defect site. What\nis not well understood is the in situ timing of the release of\nthese signals based on the progression of the regeneration'
1432: page_content='process, and how they work in concert at given intervals to\nachieve the desired effect. The rate of release of the mole-\ncules into the tissues is governed by the scaffold type and\ndegradation rate in addition to the diffusion rate of the mole-'

1435: page_content='periodontal wound besides within a scaffold.\nRecently,\ngenetic approaches have been attempted using adenovirus\nvectors (in vivo technique) or harvesting and expansion of\nselected cells before gene transduction and replacement into'
1436: page_content='the defect site (ex vivo technique).14 This technique appears\nto be a promising strategy for modulating the host response\nand regeneration of the periodontal apparatus. Its apparent\nadvantages over traditional molecule delivery include improved'
1437: page_content='sustainability of the needed molecule within the regenerating\nsite, reduction of technical challenges surrounding ex vivo\nprotein expression and puriﬁcation, temporary and controlled\ndelivery of genetic sequences encoding a group of factors'

1439: page_content='to healing.23 Lastly, a promising gene therapy approach using\nnaked DNA in a biodegradable carrier, called gene-activated\nmatrix (GAM), can carry and deliver important DNA directly\nto the host’s cells to produce a therapeutic effect. The principle'

1612: page_content='there is a problem. Additionally, for many patients, periodontal\ndisease is quite advanced by the time the patient is ﬁrst pre-\nsented to the veterinarian, and adequate regeneration of peri-'
1613: page_content='odontal structures in severe defects is still limited. Finally,\nmost canine and feline companions do not actually require\ntheir teeth in order to live lives with good quality, due to the\nwidespread use of appropriately formulated diets that can be'

1616: page_content='more success with their own oral health, interest in preservation\nof the dentition of their companion animals appears to be\nincreasing. For the patients, being able to express normal\nbehaviors like chewing may also provide a beneﬁt. And, as'
1617: page_content='humans live longer and wish to continue to preserve their\nown natural dentition, companion animal life spans are also\nincreasing, and a similar desire by clients may follow. Ideally,\nthese regenerative techniques should be available in the arma-'
